Introduction
Information and Communication Technology is increasingly at the core of strategies 
aimed at securing the goals of sustainable development and stimulating economic growth 
around the world.  Among others, these technologies are shaping the way of social 
interaction that takes place and public services are delivered in some fundamental ways.
The transmission of data and information from one place to another for the purpose of 
communication is known as telecommunication. The examples of telecommunication 
are mobile phone, Internet phone, television, landline, radio, etc. Network is an 
interconnection of different devices using wired or wireless media to exchange data 
and information.  
From 1950 to 1980 AD, developed countries like Germany, England, France, America, 
etc.  processed data by EDP (Electronic Data Processing Center). In Nepal, data was 
processed by National Computer Center (NCC). It was established in 1974 AD and 
processed data until 1996. Microcomputer was used to process national level census 
data by Central Bureau of Statistics in 1998 AD. Hotel booking, air ticketing, banking, 
email and Internet, etc. are services provided by use of computer and telecommunication 
after 1995 AD. 
The group of computers all over the world is inter-connected through different media 
to transfer information. Nowadays, different types of computer network are used in 
private as well as government sector in Nepal. 
The process of sending and receiving data and information between two or more than 
two people is known as communication.
Data Communication Mode
Data communication is the process of transferring data and information between 
computers and other electronic devices. The two types of data communication are as 
follows:
Networking and Telecommunication

Computer Science : Grade 10
a. 
Simplex Mode
Simplex mode is the transmission of data and information that takes place in only one 
direction.
It is a unidirectional mode of data transmission.
Radio, newspaper, television broadcasting, books etc. are examples of simplex mode.
Simplex Transmission Mode
b. 
Duplex Mode
Duplex is mode of data transmission in which data and information flow in both 
directions. It is bi-directional mode of data transmission. The two types of duplex 
modes are:
i. 
Half Duplex 
Half-duplex is the mode of data and information that flows in both directions but only 
one direction at a time. Walky-talky and wireless handset are examples of half-duplex 
mode.
Half Duplex Transmission Mode
ii. 
Full Duplex 
In full duplex mode, data and information flow in both direction simultaneously on 
the transmission path. Mobile and landline phones are examples of full duplex mode.

Full Duplex Transmission Mode
Components of Data Communication 
The five basic components (data, sender, medium, receiver and protocol) are required 
to make data communication. 
Data (message) : Data is to be communicated between sender and receiver. 
Sender : Sender is a device used to transfer data.
Medium: Medium is a channel through which sender and receiver make communication.
Receiver: Receiver is a device used to receive data.
Protocol: Protocol is a set of rules followed by sender and receiver.
Communication Media 
A channel or path through which data and information are transmitted between connected 
devices in a network environment is called communication media. Communication media 
is also called transmission media. It acts as a communication channel for connecting 
different devices. Wire or wireless media is used for communication. The two main 
Data Communication

Computer Science : Grade 10
types of communication media are:
1. 
Guided (Wired/bounded) communication media
2. 
Unguided (Wireless/unbounded) communication media
1. 
Guided (Wired/bounded) Communication Media 
The media which uses cable or wire to transfer data and information among computers 
are called guided communication media. This is an easy, fast and secure way to transfer 
data and information from one computer to another. The different types of wire or cable 
are used for a computer network. The three types of wire or cable are:
a. 
Twisted pair Wire
b. 
Co-Axial Cable
c. 
Fiber Optic Cable
a. 
Twisted Pair Wire
Twisted pair wire is made of copper and a pair of wires are twisted together and insulated 
with plastic. It is commonly used in communication media. This is also widely used in 
landline telephone. RJ-45 connector is the most popular connector used in twisted-pair 
wire. The two types of twisted pair wire are:
i. 
UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)  
Unshielded twisted pair cable or wire is most popular wire. This is used to transfer data 
and information in telephone connection. The cable without a shield is called unshielded 
twisted pair. Its grade starts from cat1 to cat7. It is easy, cheap and can cover a distance 
of 100 meters. The capacity of wire to transfer data from one computer to other is 
called bandwidth. Unshielded twisted pair has low bandwidth and measures in Mbps 
(Megabits per second).
ii. 
STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) 
Shielded twisted pair is a wire woven with a copper shield. Cabling is more difficult 
to install and more expensive than UTP. Its bandwidth is 10 to 500 Mbps (Megabits 
per second). RJ 45 connector is used in STP. It provides better protection against EMI 
(Electromagnetic Interference) than UTP.
Computer Science : Grade 10

Twisted Pair Cable
b. 
Co-Axial Cable 
Co-axial cable is made of copper or aluminium wire with an inner conductor surrounded 
by an insulating layer and again surrounded by conducting shield. So it consists of two 
conductors inner and outer conductors. It has high bandwidth and noise immunity. It 
is widely used in long-distance telephone lines. BNC and T connectors are the most 
popular connector used in co-axial cable.
Co-Axial Cable
c. 
Fiber Optic Cable 
Fiber optic cable is made of plastic or glass fiber to transmit data. It uses light wave 
to carry data signal from one end of the cable to other end. It is of high quality and 
transmits data signals at very high speed. It is more powerful than twisted pair cable and 
co-axial cable. So it is widely used cable especially in ISP (Internet Service Provider). ST 
(Straight Tip) connector, SMA (Screw-Mounted Adaptors), SC (Subscriber Connector) 
6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
etc. are the common connectors used in fiber optic cable.
Fiber Optic Cable
2. 
Unguided (Wireless/unbounded) Communication Media
Unguided communication is a communication channel in which data and information 
transferred between two devices without using wire or cable. Nowadays, wireless 
technology is used in communication technology. It uses radio signal for receiving and 
transmitting electronic data.
Permission for the use of wireless technology is to be taken from Nepal government. 
The three types of wireless communication are:
 
Radio Wave
 
Micro Wave
 
Satellite Communication 
a. 
Radio Wave 
Radio wave is an electronic magnetic wave. In Nepal, radio wave transmission is used 
in rural and hilly areas. The data and information can be changed into audio signals 
using high frequency wave on the basis of frequency, amplitude and phase modulation. 
The wave is modulated due to its frequency change known as FM (Frequency 
Modulation).
The wave is modulated due to its amplitude change known as AM (Amplitude 
Modulation).
The wave is modulated due to its phase change known as PM (Phase Modulation).
So, radio wave is wave or pattern received after modulation of signals.

Radio Wave
b. 
Microwave
Microwave is high frequency wave which is used to transfer signals through atmosphere. 
It is also called line of sight communication. The microwave signal cannot bend or pass 
obstacles like hill and tall buildings. So transmitting and receiving devices should be 
in a clear line of sight fitted on very high towers, repeaters until to amplify the signal 
for long-distance communication in microwave. Digital modem and antenna are the 
important microwave devices.
Microwave
Satellite Communication
Satellite communication is used to transfer information wirelessly worldwide after 1965. 
It is an artificial satellite placed in outer space for the purpose of telecommunication, 
radio, television, Internet, etc. Text, photo, video, etc. can be transferred worldwide 
using satellite communication. It is like microwave relay stations in the space or sky.

Nowadays, most of the countries use their own satellite to communicate.
Satellite Communication
Computer Network
Computer network is a group of two or more computers and devices connected to each 
other through wired or wireless media to exchange data and information and share 
hardware, software and other resources. In other word, the interconnection of many 
computers to share information is called computer network. It can share resources like 
scanner, printer, hard disk, operating system software, application software, etc. within 
the networking computer. The services provided by computer network are print service, 
message service, application service, file service, database service, etc.

analog signal to digital signal and the vice versa. So, it is a device which connects 
computers to ISP (Internet Service Provider) by the help of telephone line or router 
device. The MODEM which is placed inside the CPU Casing is called internal modem. 
MODEM which is placed outside the Casing is called an external modem.
External MODEM
Bandwidth
The amount of data that can be carried from one point to another in a given time period 
is called bandwidth. It is measured in bits per second (bps). A MODEM that works at 
57600 bps has twice the bandwidth of a MODEM that works at 28800 bps.
Network Software
Network software is an important software which controls and manages computer 
network. It is also called NOS (Network Operating System). Novell Netware is a popular 
NOS. Windows NT, Windows XP, Linux, Banyan Vinex, etc. are other example of NOS. 
The main functions of NOS are:
 
It helps to setup and install network.

Protocol 
A set of rules followed for interconnection and communication between computers 
in a network is called a protocol. So it is rules followed while sending and receiving 
information using network software. NCP (Network Control Protocol) was the first 
protocol. Some common protocols are as follows:
 
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is used in Internet.
 
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer HTML documents in 
WWW. 
 
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used in sending e-mail. 
 
POP (Post Office Protocol) is used to retrieve e-mail from a mail server.
 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used to transmitting files between computers.
Types of Network
Computer network can be classified according to its area covered. The main three types 
of computer network on the basis of geographical location (area covered) are:
1. 
LAN (Local Area Network)
2. 
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
3. 
WAN (Wide Area Network) 
1. 
LAN (Local Area Network)
Local Area Network is a network limited within a small area like a room, a building, 
school, college, etc. generally connected through wire media. It can cover up to one 
kilometre for transferring data and information between the computers. It has high 
speed data transfer capacity than MAN and WAN. Computer in LAN can be connected 
through wireless media and is referred to as WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network).

Wide Area Network
Network Architecture/Model
Network architecture defines how the computer communicates and interacts with each 
other on network. It is combined form of topologies and data transmission mode between 
the different computers in the network. The three types of network architecture are:
1. 
Peer to Peer Network 
In this type of network, all nodes on the network have an equal relationship with each 
other. It is also called workgroup. It can share data, hardware and software with each 
other. It is suitable for a small area such as small offices, small room, building, etc. It 
uses many operating systems such as Windows 2000, Windows 8, Macintosh Operating 
System etc., have built-in features to support peer to peer network.
Advantage of Peer to Peer Network
 
All resources and contentions can be shared in this network.
 
System administrator is not required and each user can control their shared 
resources.
 
The failure of one computer doesn't affect the functioning of other peers.
Disadvantages of Peer to Peer Network
 
It is difficult for administrator and control as resources are decentralized in this 
18  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
network.
 
Security is very low in this system.
 
Data recovery or backup is very difficult.
Peer to Peer Network
Client-Server Network
A network model where one or more powerful computers (servers) provide the different 
network services and all other users of computer network (clients) access those services 
to perform user's tasks is known as client-server network. In such networks, there exists 
a central controller called server. A server is a specialized computer that controls the 
network resource and provides services to other computers in the network.
Novell Netware, Windows NT, Linux, etc. are the common examples of an operating 
system of client-server network. 
Advantages of Client-Server Network
 
Centralized back up is possible in client-server computer network.
 
The use of dedicated servers also increases the speed of sharing resources.
 
Security is better in this network as all the shared resources are centrally 
administered.
Disadvantages of Client-Server Network
 
It requires specialized servers with large memory. This leads to an increase in the 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 19
cost.
 
The cost of network operating system that manages the various clients is also 
high.
 
It requires network administrator.
Client-Server Network
3. 
Centralized Network 
In this network, the main computer is known as host or server computer. Workstation 
is just used for input/output operations, which has no processing capabilities and are 
connected to server or host computer. Linux or UNIX operating system is used in 
centralized network.
Advantages of Centralized Network 
 
It saves cost of installation of network system. 
 
It secures all data and information on host computer which works on IPOS (input 
process output system).

Centralized Network
Topology
Network topology is the inter-connected pattern of network components. A network 
topology may be physical, mapping hardware configuration, or logical, mapping the path 
that the data must take in order to travel around the network. A LAN Topology is cabling 
structure or pattern of computers in local area. The three main types of topology are:
1. 
Bus Topology 
2. 
Ring Topology 
3. 
Star Topology
1. 
Bus Topology
This type of topology uses a segment of single cable to connect nodes. All nodes and 
network devices are connected to single cable called bus topology. Terminators are 
attached at the cable's start and end points. When it has exactly two end points, it is 
called linear bus topology. 
Advantages of Bus Topology 
 
It is cost effective and cable required is least compared to other network topology.
 
It is used in small networks and easy to understand.
 
It is easy to expand networks.
Disadvantage of Bus Topology
 
Break/Failure in main cable will make the whole network to malfunction.
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 21
 
Heavy network traffic or increase in nodes will degrade performance of network.
 
Terminators are necessary at both ends of the cable.
Bus Topology
2. 
Ring/Loop Topology 
Ring topology forms a closed-loop as each computer is connected to another computer 
with the last one connected to the first is called ring topology. It uses fiber optic cable 
to transfer data. Each and every computer has equal responsibilities. A number of 
repeaters are used for Ring topology with large number of nodes. Data is transferred 
in a sequential manner.
Advantages of Ring Topology 
 
In this topology all computers, in close loop, act as a client or server to transfer 
the information.
 
Transmitting network is not affected by high traffic or by adding more nodes.
 
It is cheap to install or setup and expand.
Disadvantages of Ring Topology
 
It is difficult for troubleshooting.
 
In ring topology, adding or deleting the computers disturbs the network activity.
 
Failure of one computer disturbs the whole network in this topology.
22  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Ring Topology
3. 
Star Topology
It is a type of topology which connects all nodes to central device called hub/switch 
through a cable. It is probably the most common topology. Switch acts as a repeater for 
data flow. Star topology can be used with twisted pair, optical fiber and coaxial cable.
Advantages of Star Topology 
 
It provides fast performance and low network traffic. 
 
It is easy to troubleshoot setup and modify.
 
The failure of one node has not affected the rest of the nodes.
Disadvantages of Star Topology
 
Hub and more wires are required, so the cost of installation is high.
 
The whole network is stopped when the hub fails.
 
The system crucially depends on control device switch/hub. If it fails, entire 
network fails.

The Internet and its services
Internet is a network of networks. The worldwide connection of computer networks that 
use TCP/IP protocols to communicate with one another using wire or wireless media 
as well as network devices is called the Internet. 
Internet was originated in 1969 AD by ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency 
Network). ARPANET provides communication among various bodies of government 
which was developed by United States Department of Defense. 
In 1992 AD, the Internet was openly used throughout the world. In Nepal, Internet 
service was started by Mercantile Company in 1994 AD.
Internet Services
Internet is the interconnection of computers that are spread all over the world. It is used 
to get information and is used in many sectors such as education, business, entertainment, 
news, etc. The main internet services are as follows:
1. 
World Wide Web
World Wide Web was developed by Tim-Berners-Lee of European Laboratory for 
Particle Physics; Switzerland in 1989 AD tested on 200 computers. 
It is also called the web. It is a term used to describe the interlinked collection of 
hypertext documents and multimedia content available on internet. Web is a collection 
of internet host systems that make these services available on the Internet using the 
24  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). Web document includes text, audio, video, graphic, 
etc. embedded. It is an information space where web document and web resources are 
identified by URL (Uniform Resource Locators). Web based information is usually 
delivered in the form of hypertext and hypermedia using HTML.
2. 
Email 
E-mail stands for electronic mail. It is the most widely used service on the Internet. E-mail 
sends and receivs messages electronically through the Internet.  The message can 
be exchanged around the world using e-mail. It is very easy and quick means of 
communication. We can write an E-Mail message in mail programs like Eudora, Outlook 
Express, Netscape Navigator etc. and several web based programs like Yahoo mail, Hot 
mail, G mail and Zapak mail are also used for sending and receiving e-mails.
E-mail address: Each e-mail address is identified by a unique name. For example 
sarthak1@gmail.com. It has four parts they are as follows:
 
sarthak1 : User’s name
 
@ (At the rate): A separator symbol
 
gmail : domain name
 
.com, .edu or .net : "commercial" "organization" or "network" 
Advantages of using E-mail
 
It is the cheapest and fastest means of communication.
 
It is more reliable than postal mail.
 
E-mail can be accessed from any part of the world at any time.
 
Information can be shared globally.
 
We can send photos, songs, video clips and other file with e-mail attachments.
 
A single mail can be sent to multiple people at a time.

Telnet (Teletype Network)
Telnet is the facility of Internet that allows user to use a remote computer through Internet. 
It was developed in 1969 AD. When it connects computer to the remote computers, 
the remote computer asks to enter user name and password. It can connect and interact

remote host or computer to your computer. Telnet is most likely to be used by program 
developers and anyone who has a need to use specific applications or data located at a 
particular host computer.
4. 
FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is transmission files between computers on the Internet. 
It is a client/server protocol that relies on two communication channels between client 
and server as command channel for controlling the conversation and data channel for 
transmitting file content. Clients initiate conversations with servers by requesting to 
download a file. Using FTP, a client can upload, download, delete, and rename, move 
and copy files on a server. A user typically needs to log on to FTP server.
5. 
Search Engine
Search engine is the communication program that searches documents on the basis of 
specified keywords and returns a list of the web links that matches the keywords. Google, 
Ask, Alta Vista, Bing and Yahoo can search for files on WWW (World Wide Web). 
Search engines utilize automated software applications (referred to as robots, bots, or 
spiders) that travel along the Web, following links from page to page, site to site. The 
information gathered by the spiders is used to create a searchable index of the Web.
Nowadays, Google is the most used search engine. Google search engine available in 
Nepali language as well.

Computer Science : Grade 10
Ethics generally refers to the principles to make the decisions to lead our society or 
an individual for a better life. It is derived from the Greek word “ethos” which refers 
to character, guiding beliefs, standards or ideals that pervade (comes across) a group, 
community or people.
As ICT has totally dominated our lives, it has influenced our personal, social and moral 
values as well. As day by day more and more people are getting connected with the 
present digital world through the Internet which does not have a strong body to govern 
the rules and regulations to safeguard or guarantee the proper and improper usage of the 
technology. There are so many social networking sites; most of the people are connected 
to at least one such site, but we do not know exactly whether our personal information 
is properly maintained or not. This has created a lot of issues which has encouraged 
our digital society to focus on the ethics relating to ICT.
1.2.1 Computer Ethics
Ethics deals with placing a “value” on acts according to 
whether they are “good” or “bad”. Every society has its 
rules about whether certain acts are ethical or not. These 
rules have been established as a result of consensus in 
society and are often written into laws. When computers 
first began to be used in society at large, the absence of 
ethical standards about their use and related issues caused 
some problems. However, as their use became widespread 
in every facet of our lives, discussions in computer ethics resulted in some kind of a 
consensus. Today, many of these rules have been formulated as laws, either national 
or international. Computer ethics is a set of moral principles or code of conducts that 
regulate the use of computers systematically without making harm to other users. 
It gives awareness to the user regarding the immoral behaviour and activities in the 
computing field.

Some important commandments of computer ethics are:
 
Do not use a computer to harm other people.
 
Do not use a computer to publish fake information.
 
Do not search the file or record of other people.
 
Do not destroy or delete the records of other people.
 
Do not use a computer to steal someone's privacy. 
 
Do not interfere with other people's computer work. 
 
Do not snoop around in other people's files. 
 
Do not use or copy software for which you have not paid. 
 
Do not use other people's computer resources without authorization. 
1.2.2 Cyber Ethics
Cyber ethics is a code of behaviour for using the Internet. It is 
acceptable behaviour on the Internet which is very much the 
same as acceptable behaviour in everyday life. For instance, 
at an early age, children learn what it means to be honest and 
to respect the rights and property of others. They are taught to 
not take what does not belong to them and to be considerate 
of others. On the Internet, the same basic rules apply.
Cyber ethics is distinct from cyber law. Laws are formal written directives that apply 
to everyone, interpreted by the judicial system, and enforced by the police. Ethics is a 
broad philosophical concept that goes beyond simple right and wrong, and looks towards 
"the good life". The objective of cyber ethics is to ESTABLISHING A CULTURE OF 
PROPER USE of the Internet and Computers.
Do's and Don’ts of cyber ethics
DO
DON'T
Do use the Internet to help you do your 
schoolwork. 
Don't copy information from the Internet and 
call it your own.
Do use the Internet to learn about music, 
video and games.
Don't use the Internet to download or share 
copyrighted material
36  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Do use the Internet to communicate with 
friends and family
Don't use the Internet to communicate with 
strangers
Don't pretend to be someone else
Don't be rude or use bad language
Don't give anyone personal information or 
passwords
Cyber ethics mainly deals with the following domains:
 
Privacy
 
 Property
 
Security
 
 Accuracy
 
 Accessibility
 
Censorship and Filtering
1.2.3 Digital Citizenship
Digital Citizenship refers to the use of 
technology as a measure of behaviour 
responsible for a digital society. Its importance 
is working in cyberspace and learning how 
to safely and legally compute. In this digital 
age, it is most necessary to be a digital citizen. 
Internet is used to connect people around the 
world. We can read text from a computer, 
smartphone or tablet. We can also connect with each other through social media. We 
act as digital citizens. Following are the elements of digital citizenship:
 
Digital Access: The state of full electronic participation in society
 
Digital Commerce: The act of promoting the purchase of goods through electronic 
means
 
Digital Communication: Electronic exchange of information 
 
Digital literacy: Teaching and learning about teaching and technology
 
Digital Security: Electronic precautions 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 37
 
Digital Health: The solution to health problems using digital technology
 
Digital Law: Act, rules and regulations required for performing electrical work
1.2.4 Digital Footprint
Digital Footprint means the recording of interaction with the digital world. We leave 
behind the Digital Footprint trail using online technology. 
These include digital cameras, i-pods, smartphones, laptops 
and computers. Therefore, a digital footprint is like an 
invisible report card which is stored for many years. This 
gives a general reflection of our online activity. Digital 
Footprints can be used for both good and bad purpose. The 
following should be considered when managing Digital 
Footprint:
 
Subscribed accounts and unused social media accounts 
which are no longer in use should be unsubscribed or deleted.
 
Ensure the content posted protect your privacy.
 
Not to forget that online posts are private.
 
To note that parents, teachers and other people can view the content posted. 
 
Ensure the content posted does not damage yours or others reputation.
1.2.5 Cyberbullying
Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, 
computers, and tablets. Cyberbullying can occur through SMS, Text, and apps, or 
online in social media, forums, or gaming 
where people can view, participate in, or share 
content. Cyberbullying includes sending, 
posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, 
or mean content about someone else. It can 
include sharing personal or private information 
about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses 
the line into unlawful or criminal behaviour.
38  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
The most common places where cyberbullying occurs are:
 
Social Media, such as Facebook, Instagram, Snap Chat, and Twitter
 
SMS (Short Message Service) also known as Text Message sent through cell 
phone
 
Instant Message (via devices, email provider services, apps, and social media 
messaging features)
 
Email
Examples of cyberbullying:
 
Sending rude emails, texts or instant messages online or on the phone
 
Being excluded from online groups or forums
 
Offensive chat on online gaming
 
Posting hurtful things about someone on social media
 
Spreading rumours or gossip about someone online
 
Making fun of someone in an online chat that includes multiple people
 
Attacking or killing an avatar or character in an online game, constantly and on 
purpose
 
Pretending to be another person by creating a fake online profile
 
Threatening or intimidating someone online or in a text message
 
Taking an embarrassing photo or video and sharing it without permission
1.2.6 Cyber Law
Success in any field of human activity in certain 
field, area of development and progress may 
simultaneously craft an offensive road as well 
to reach that success. That offensive mechanism 
surely needs mechanisms to control it. Legal 
provisions should provide assurance to users, 
empowerment to law enforcement agencies and 
deterrence to criminals. With the development of the internet, the access of people in 
the computers worldwide has increased. It has provided many new opportunities. But 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 39
along with these new opportunities, there were people trying to take advantage of these 
developments to harm others. That is the reason cyber law is required. A law should 
not be considered as a tool to punish the wrongdoers but it is a tool to define how the 
activities shall be carried out which is acceptable to all stakeholders. Laws are prepared 
by the state and enforced by state machinery. Absence of proper law makes difficulty 
for the authorities to regulate and control the activities.
Cyber law describes the legal issues related to using of inter-networked information 
technology. Cyber law is a term that encapsulates the legal issues related to the use 
of communicative, transactional, and distributive aspects of networked information 
devices and technologies. 
Cyber law is not one law but it is a set of different laws meant to control and regularize 
the activities taking place in the cyberspace. (Cyberspace is the virtual environment 
created by the Internet and devices and services related to the Internet.) Some leading 
topics of cyber law include hacking, intellectual property theft, credit card cloning, 
phishing, cyberbullying, privacy issue; freedom of expression, jurisdiction and the list 
goes on and on. To regulate the crime in this dimension of our life, governments come 
up with “Cyber Law.”
1.2.7 ICT Policy 2072
Information technology (IT) is 
the use of any computers, storage, 
networking and other physical 
devices, infrastructure and processes 
to create, process, store, secure and 
exchange all forms of electronic data. IT includes several layers of physical 
equipment (hardware), virtualization and management or automation tools, 
operating systems and applications (software) used to perform essential functions 
such as laptops, smartphones etc. Combination of information technology and 
telecommunication technology is called information communication technology (ICT).
The government of Nepal revised the former policy and came up with the Information 
Communication Policy 2072 (2015) intending to regulate Information Communication 
Nepal's
National Information and
Communication Technology
(ICT) Policy, 2015
40  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Technology as a whole. This policy emphasizes the need for a precise and 
consistent enactment and regulatory framework for addressing converged regime of 
telecommunications, broadcasting and ICT. The use of ICT can make the government 
more efficient and effective, facilitate more accessible government services, allow 
greater public access to information, and make government more accountable. It is 
the most cost-effective tool in improving public service delivery and government to 
government (G2G) communication.
This policy is primarily designed to guide and mainstream the use of ICTs in all sectors 
of the Nepalese economy within the overall context of socio-economic development 
and poverty reduction agenda pursued by the country. The policy states that appropriate 
programs will be developed and implemented to improve following sectors like 
education, agriculture, health, research and development, industry, promotion of 
e-Commerce, tourism, cloud computing, telecommunication and so on through the 
use of ICTs.
The followings are the few goals the policy envisages to achieve:
 
Enhancement of overall national ICT readiness with the objective of being at 
least in the top second quartile of the international ICT development index and 
e-Government rankings by 2020

75 % of the population to have digital literacy skills by the end of 2020

Universal broadband access to all people on an equitable basis to be in place. By 
2020, 90 percent of the population to have access to broadband services

The role and significance of ICT industries and services (including telecom 
services) to increase in the Nepali economy with ICT value added (including 
digital content and service industry) accounting for at least 7.5% of GDP by 2020 

Apex level institutional arrangement to be restructured to effectively drive ICT 
agenda in the country in the light of emerging technologies and application trends 
shaping the sector

By 2020, entire population of Nepal to have access to Internet

80% of all citizens facing government services to be offered online by 2020

e-Procurement to be promoted as means of driving transparency through 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 41
government procurement processes covering all public procurement of goods 
and services irrespective of cost and volume of such procurements by 2018

G2G implementation to be promoted with a view to achieve complete automation 
of the operations of land administration, revenue administration and management, 
vital registration, passport and citizenship certificate services by 2020
1.2.8 Electronic Transaction Act (ETA)
Electronic Transaction Act (ETA) deals 
with issues related to cybercrime and also 
help in making and implementing laws 
over cybercrime. It has made different 
requirements so that if anyone found 
committing cybercrime, he/she will be 
punished according to the nature of the crime. 
The legal provisions for authentication and regularization of the recognition, validity, 
integrity and reliability of generation, production, processing, storage, communication 
and transmission system of electronic records by making the transactions to be 
carried out by means of electronic data exchange or by any other means of electronic 
communications, reliable and secured and for controlling the acts of unauthorized use 
of electronic records or of making alteration in such records through the illegal manner 
ETA has been enacted to regulate electronic business.
The house of representative (HoR) of the government of Nepal approved the electronic 
transaction act- 2063 on Mangsir 18, 2063 (December 4, 2006) and the era of electronic 
transaction is started in Nepal.
1.2.9 Opportunities and Threats in Social Media
Social media is a process of performing a variety of tech-enabled activities via 
virtual communities and network. It plays a vital role in changing the way of people 
communicate and keep in touch. Social media includes activities such as photo sharing, 
blogging, social networks, video sharing, business networks, virtual worlds, etc. It 
also provides a platform to build career opportunities and share the thoughts, feelings, 
42  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
insight and emotions. Social media is an important approach to digital marketing. It is 
an indispensable tool for business. Even governments and politicians use social media 
to engage with constituents and voters. Social media is continuously evolving with all 
marketing channels. It is providing tremendous opportunities for various brands to reach 
their customers. Some of the opportunities and benefits of social media are as follows:
i. 
Brand Development
Branding is an important stage in any business that focuses on long-term business. 
Social media is a spectacular tool to grow a business. It allows customers to connect 
and interact with the business on a more personal level.
ii. 
Target Audience
Social media is one of the effective platforms to reach the target audience. For example, 
83% of social advertisers get connected to Instagram in order to attract a younger 
audience whereas 80% of social media leads come from LinkedIn.

Social Media Threats
i. 
Social Engineering
One of the biggest threats of social media is social engineering. It allows attackers to 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 43
find personal information that can be used to target specific individuals.
ii. 
Targeted Phishing Attacks
These attacks are carried out to steal money or certain confidential information. Targeted 
Phishing attacks are frequently successful as they focus on the organization's weakest 
point "Employee". 
iii. 
Fake Accounts
In July 2010, a fake profile named Robin Sage was made to request connections to 
random people, which most of them accepted without knowing who the woman was. 
The seriousness of such social media threats are underscored and is considered that 
the fake account, in this case, was successful in connecting thousands of peoples from 
various different fields.
iv. 
Social Media used for spreading spam and malware 
Certain users in social media are found sharing malicious contents. They create unwanted 
spam and are shared through chat, comments and more. The spam and malicious contents 
can appear in many forms such as bulk messages, hate speech, fake friends and many 
more

Introduction
Computer has become inseparable from 
our life. It is not only different types of 
computers that have become part of our life 
but smaller devices like smartphones and 
gadgets have become an integrated part of 
our life. It has opened the door to an infinite 
amount of information stored in the clouds 
and, thus, many opportunities. 
Computer is no more a machine sitting 
on our desk or our lap. There is no sector of society where computer or information 
technology related products are not used. It is now a part of the global system of cyber. 
Almost all the computers are connected through the Internet. When we are talking 
about computer, now, we are talking about the cyberspace where the interconnection 
of computers throughout the world makes a virtual world of information system. 
Computer security means protecting our computer and its content from damage, theft 
or misuse and action to prevent such incidents. The expansion and interconnection of 
computing system globally has also increased threat in computer security. Nowadays, 
computer security becomes a part of broader cyber security. At the present time, almost 
everything is connected to the Internet and provides services online which include banks, 
government offices, universities, companies and almost everything. This increases the 
motivation of the culprits to steal information, resources and even money from the 
banks. That has also increasesd the need of knowledge about cybersecurity, commitment 
to abide by it and legal provisions to prevent and penalize crimes related to the cyber 
world. Computer security includes security of:
 
data and information – stored or being transferred
 
computer programs and applications
 
credentials

Let's discuss about them here.
1.3.1 Information Security
We use computers to process different types 
of data, store them, share and transfer them. 
Data and information are we can say, the 
purpose of we using computer systems. It is 
crucial that the data and information stored in 
the computer system are protected and they 
are securely transferred to or shared with 
intended person or place without interference 
or theft. 
First, let's talk about the security of stored data. We store data in our computer's hard 
disk – also in CD, DVD or pen drives at times. The data should be protected from loss 
or unauthorized access. The data is lost when we accidentally delete, our hard disk 
crashes or the whole computer is damaged due to fire, flood or natural calamities or 
the machine is stolen.
We can protect our data:
 
by periodically checking the hard 
disk and replacing it if it shows 
failure symptoms;
 
by copying the data in another 
disk in the system to avoid 
accidentally erasing or erasing 
data by unauthorized person;
 
Nowadays, we can copy important 
data into online storage devices which is also called cloud storage. There are many 
providers who provide space in the cloud for online storage of our data which 
include Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud. Some of them are free up to 
the certain size of storage space. 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 49
 
We can also, sometimes, send important files as an attachment to our own mail 
such as Gmail or Hotmail.  
 
Another issue of protecting data is preventing them from authorized access. 
Unauthorized users may access our data store in our computer in the cloud storage. 
To prevent our data from unauthorized access we have to protect the storage space, 
folder or file with password.  
i. 
Security Threats
There are computer security threats which can risk program, data and information at the 
local computer and in the clouds. So, we discuss them here as Cyber Security Threats 
and in the next section, we will discuss some measures to protect from these threats.
a) 
Phishing: Phishing is the fake attempt 
to obtain sensitive information such 
as usernames, passwords and credit 
card details by disguising oneself as 
a trustworthy entity in an electronic 
communication. Typically carried out 
by email spoofing or instant messaging, 
it often directs users to enter personal information at a fake website which matches 
the look and feel of the legitimate site. It could involve an attachment to an 
email that loads malware onto your 
computer. It could also be a link to an 
illegitimate website that can trick you 
into downloading malware or handing 
over your personal information.
b) 
Botnet: A botnet is a logical collection 
of Internet-connected devices such as 
computers, smartphones or internet of 
things (IoT) devices whose security 
have been breached and control is 
given away to a third party. Each 
compromised device, known as a 
50  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
"bot", is created when a device is penetrated by software from a malware (malicious 
software) distribution. The controller of a botnet is able to direct the activities 
of these compromised computers through communication channels formed by 
standards-based network protocols, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). 
Botnets are increasingly rented out by cybercriminals as commodities for a variety 
of purposes.
c) 
Rootkit: A rootkit is a malicious code (kit) that hides in system area provides 
continued Administrator's (root) privileged access to a computer while actively 
hiding its presence. Once a rootkit has been installed, the controller of the rootkit 
has the ability to remotely execute files and change system configurations on the 
host machine. A rootkit on an infected computer can also access log files and spy 
on the legitimate computer owner’s usage.
d) 
Keylogger: Keylo gger is hardware 
or software for recording the keys 
pressed on a keyboard secretly so 
that person using the keyboard does 
not know that their actions are being 
monitored. Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program. 
While the programs themselves are legal, with many of them being designed to 
allow employers to oversee the use of their computers, keyloggers are most often 
used for stealing passwords and other confidential information.
e) 
Hacker: A computer hacker is any skilled computer expert who 
uses his/her technical knowledge to overcome a problem. While 
"hacker" can refer to any skilled computer programmer, the term 
has become associated in popular culture with a "security hacker". 
Security hackers are people involved with circumvention of 
computer security. Among security hackers, there are several types, 
including Whit hats, Black hats and Grey hats hackers.
f) 
Drive-by attack: Drive-by download attacks are a common method 
of spreading malware. Hackers look for insecure websites and plant a malicious 
script into HTTP or PHP code on one of the pages. This script might install malware 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 51
directly onto the computer of someone who visits 
the site, or it might re-direct the victim to a site 
controlled by the hackers. Drive-by downloads 
can happen when visiting a website or viewing an 
email message or a pop-up window. Unlike many 
other types of cyber security attacks, a drive-by 
doesn’t rely on a user to do anything to actively enable the attack — you don’t 
have to click a download button or open a malicious email attachment to become 
infected. A drive-by download can take advantage of an app, operating system 
or web browser that contains security flaws due to unsuccessful updates or lack 
of updates.
To protect yourself from drive-by attacks, you need to keep your browsers and 
operating systems up to date and avoid websites that might contain malicious code. 
ii. 
Malicious codes
Malicious code is the kind of harmful computer 
code or web script designed to create system 
vulnerabilities leading to back doors, security 
breaches, information and data theft, and other 
potential damages to files and computing systems. 
It's a type of threat that may not be blocked by 
antivirus software on its own. It is an auto-executable application that can activate itself 
and take on various forms, including Java Applets, ActiveX controls, pushed content, 
plug-ins, scripting languages or other programming languages that are designed to 
enhance Web pages and email.
The code gives a cybercriminal unauthorized remote access to the attacked system — 
called an application back door — which then exposes sensitive company data. By 
unleashing it, cybercriminals can even wipe out a computer's data or install spyware.
1.3.2. Security mechanisms
i. 
Authentication System
The process of identifying an individual usually based on a username and password 
is called an authentication system. In security systems, authentication is distinct from 
52  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
authorization, which is the process of giving individuals access to system objects based 
on their identity. Let’s discuss about the different authentication system:
a. 
Password
A password is a memorized secret used to confirm the 
identity of a user. In general, a password is a string of 
characters including letters, digits, or other symbols. If only 
numbers are allowed in the secret code, then it is called a 
Personal Identification Number (PIN). In computer system 
password normally comes with a username. The combination of username and password 
that is used to access a resource is offer called credentials. Credentials are required to 
gain access to our email, restricted sites, banks website to manage our account, open our 
computer, and so many other places. We have to keep the password secure and strong 
so that unauthorized users may not gain access to the resource and misuse it with our 
identity. Following are some of the tips to make our password secure and strong:
 
Never share your credentials online. 
 
Don't use easily guessable the name of a pet, child, family member, birthdays, 
birthplace, name of a favourite holiday.
 
Don't use a sequence like abcd or 1234 which are, again, easily guessable.
 
Mix characters, numbers and symbols. Also, mix small and capital letters.
 
Avoid using the same password in all applications.
 
Change password periodically.
b. 
Biometric
Nowadays, the character or numeric passwords are being replaced 
by biometric authentication. Fingerprints, face detection or retina 
detection are being used as biometrics authentication. Biometrics 
authentication is considered more secure than string password. 
c. 
Firewalls
When it comes to preventing unauthorized access of the third party in a private 
network, firewalls are used. A firewall is the network security systems that monitors and 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 53
controls the traffic flow between the Internet 
and private network or private computer 
on the basis of a set of user-defined rules. 
Firewalls shelter the computer network of an 
organization against unauthorized incoming 
or outgoing access and provide the best 
network security. Firewall can be a hardware firewall, software firewall or firewall 
incorporated in Operating System such as Windows Firewall. An OS incorporated 
firewall is a component of the Operating System and we can enable its operation by 
turning its access on. We can enable Windows firewall in our computer to protect it 
from unwanted traffic from the Internet. 
d. 
Cryptography
We share data and information with other people and institutions through the Internet. 
There are many ways we can share files- we can send them as email attachments, we 
can share them from online storage spaces. We can also share them from websites. There 
are data presented in the form of webpages, downloads from and upload to the HTTP 
or FTP sites and exchange of data using online forms.
There is a great risk that these data we have shared through the Internet are accessed 
by unauthorized users from cloud storage or they are intercepted by hackers during 
the transmission. There are also risks that the message or multimedia like: pictures 
or video clips that we share, post or stream are copied or recorded by other party and 
misused. There are many instances that the private, sensitive or objectionable picture 
or video clips that we share with our social media friends are captured or recorded and 
misused. So the rule of thumb, is not to share personal and objectionable data through 
social media or messaging apps. We will discuss different methods of stealing data in 
the Internet in the following section. Here, let's discuss some ways of securing data 
while storing or transferring them online.
We can protect our files with strong passwords so that the hacker cannot open it. A more 
reliable way is to use cryptography.
Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the 
54  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents. The term is derived 
from the Greek word “ kryptos”, which means hidden. More generally, cryptography 
is about constructing and analysing protocols that prevent third parties or the public 
from reading private messages. Cryptography includes ensuring that data/ message 
cannot be understood by an unauthorized user. There are different types of cryptography 
technology used.
i. 
Encryption
Encryption is the technology to encode file or message that is being stored or 
transferred online in intelligible content 
which cannot be used by an unauthorized 
person. The encryption is not meant to 
prevent interception but it makes the 
file or message unusable to the hacker. 
Authorized user can read or use the file or 
message after decrypting it. Generally, encryption is done with the help of key and the 
key is made available to the authorized user by another medium.
ii. 
Decryption
The conversion of encrypted data into its original 
form is decryption. It is generally a reverse process of 
encryption. It decodes the encrypted information so that 
an authorized user can only decrypt the data because 
decryption requires a secret key or password.
iii. 
Malware
The word Malware is short for malicious software and 
is a general term used to describe all of the viruses, 
spyware, worms, adware, nagware, trojan, and pretty much anything that is specifically 
designed to cause harm to your PC or steal your information. Below, we discuss, in 
brief, about different types of Malware:
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 55
a. 
Virus
A virus is a program that copies itself and infects a PC, 
spreading from one file to another, and then from one PC 
to another when the files are copied or shared. Most viruses 
attach themselves to executable files, but some can target 
a master boot record, autorun scripts, MS Office macros, designed to render your PC 
completely inoperable, while others simply delete or corrupt your files—the general 
point is that a virus is designed to cause havoc and break stuff. 
b. 
Spyware 
Spyware is any software installed on your PC that collects your information without 
your knowledge and sends that information back to the creator so they can use your 
personal information in some immoral way. This could include keylogging to learn your 
passwords, watching your searching habits. 
c. 
Trojan
Trojan horses are applications that look like they are doing something harmless, but 
secretly have malicious code that does something else. In many cases, Trojans will 
create a backdoor that allows your PC to be remotely controlled, either directly or as 
part of a botnet. The major difference between a virus and a Trojan is that Trojans don't 
replicate themselves—they must be installed by an unwitting user.
d. 
Worm
Computer worms use the network to send copies of themselves to other PCs, usually 
utilizing a security hole to travel from one host to the next, often automatically without 
user intervention. Because they can spread so rapidly across a network, infecting every 
PC in their path, they tend to be the most well-known type of malware. Some of the 
most famous worms include the ILOVEYOU worm, transmitted as an email attachment.
e. 
Adware
Adware is a software application used by companies for marketing purposes; advertising 
banners are displayed while any program is running. Adware can be automatically 
downloaded to your system while browsing any website and can be viewed through 
56  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
pop-up windows or through a bar that appears on the computer screen automatically.
1.3.3 Antivirus Software
Antivirus software, nowadays also known as anti-malware, is a computer program used 
to prevent, detect, and remove malware.
When there were standalone computers, 
antivirus software was developed to detect 
and remove computer viruses. However, 
with the creation of other kinds of malware, 
antivirus software now provides protection 
from other computer threats. Today's 
antivirus software can protect from browser 
hijackers, keyloggers, rootkits, Trojan horses, worms, adware, spyware, and many more. 
Some products also include protection from other computer threats, such as infected 
and malicious URLs, scam and phishing attacks. There are many antivirus software 
available in the market from simple Antivirus software to Internet Security System. The 
major consideration to be taken while choosing the antivirus software is its features. We 
have to see what threats it can protect our system from. Even the product of the same 
brand has different variations to provide different types of security. Some of the popular 
antivirus programs are Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2020, Norton AntiVirus(NAV) Plus, 
Webroot SecureAnywhere AntiVirus, ESET NOD32 Antivirus, F-Secure Antivirus 
SAFE, Kaspersky Anti-Virus, etc.
There are many viruses and malware being developed every day. Old Antivirus program 
cannot detect and clean new virus or malware. So, we have to ensure that the Antivirus 
software we are using has the latest updates. Most of the Antivirus software now comes 
with an online update facility. 
1.3.4 Backing System
You never know when or how data may be lost. A simple disk error can do just as much 
damage as a hacker might do. And even the most experienced computer user occasionally 
deletes a file or folder by accident. When such events happen, you’ll be in trouble if 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 57
your data aren’t backed up. Backup is the system of 
copying data and programs into another location or 
creating a duplicate copy of it’s in a secured place. 
Backups are essential to computer security system to 
save important data and programs from the accidental 
or intentional harm. Any organization that does not 
maintain backups of data and information would need 
to spend resources in recreating data if data is corrupted. When data and software are 
corrupted or lost, we can recover them from the backup copy. Backups can be kept in 
different locations such as hard disks, compact disc, external hard drive and on the cloud 
(Internet). So, Backups are important methods of data and software security measures 
against data corruption or loss. 
1.3.5 Hardware Security
Computer is made of electronic boards, chips, electromagnetic devices like hard disk, 
electromechanical parts like CPU Fan, DVD-Drive motors etc. The hardware can be 
damaged by:
 
dust dirt on mechanical parts;
 
water and moisture on the electronic circuits;
 
irregular electricity on the circuit boards;
 
overheating of the device 
 
fire burning the machine
 
theft of the computer and its devices
 
So, to protect the computer hardware we can take the following measures;
i. 
Regular Maintenance
 
Keep the computer room clean. 
 
Arrange regular maintenance of the 
computer system and devices. During 
the periodic maintenance dust and dirt 
should clean off the computer’s devices, loose connections of electricity and 
58  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
network devices and parts inside the computers are should be fixed. 
 
Faulty devices are detected and replaced. We can do this by bringing our computers 
and devices to the service centre or by having Annual Maintenance Contract 
(AMC) with a service providing company depending on the policy of organization 
and number of computers and devices.
ii. 
Insurance
Insurance is a way to get the investment – whole or part of it – back in case, the computer 
system is damaged because of theft, vandalism or natural calamities like fire or flood. 
For insurance of assets we have to contact the agent of a non-life insurance company 
and against the payment of a nominal amount of money as premium every year we can 
ensure our computer and other assets. 
iii. 
Free from dust
Often dust build-up occurs in computer case fans, inside 
the power supply or CPU cooler. When CPU cooler fails 
to spin because of dust build-up, processor can overheat 
and become damaged. If the power supply fan blows, this 
can become a serious fire hazard because of the heat being 
generated. These components need to be maintained for 
safety on a regular basis. So, the compute room has to be 
absolutely free from dust and air pollution.
iv. 
Fire extinguisher
Install fire extinguishers in the computer room. So that in case of fire we 
can extinguish the fire quickly and minimize damage.
v. 
Theft
The computer room should have physical security with proper locking system, controlled 
access of authorized persons only by having human guard or biometric machine.
vi. 
Air condition system
When the computer system is used for a long time, it becomes heated. If the computer 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 59
system room contains servers and other devices that have 
to do extensive processing; then we should consider 
installing air conditioning system in the room. The air 
condition system helps to reduce the room temperature.
vii. Power protection device
Have reliable electric system – cable, switches in the computer 
room, checking and replacing them regularly.
Use voltage stabilizers, spike controllers or Uninterruptible Power 
Supplies (UPS) to avoid irregular electric supplies like high voltage, 
fluctuating voltage or power cuts.
Frequents power cuts may not only cause damage to the computer hardware but also 
causes data loss that we are currently working. An UPS is a device which has a battery 
backup in it which is charged when there is power in the mains and automatically 
switches to the battery power when the mains gets cut off and thus helps to prevent the 
computer from being turned off at the time of power cut and save our data that we are 
working. It also protects accidental damage (file being corrupt) of program or data file.

Types of E-Commerce
E-commerce can be run in different models. Here, we discuss the three basic types of 
E-Commerce
a) 
Business-to-Consumer (B2C)
The most common type of E-Commerce is Business-to-Consumer.  B2C establishes 
the electronic business relationships between a business organization (merchant) and 
final consumers. It corresponds to the retail section of e-commerce, where traditional 
retail trade normally operates.
In B2C model, business E-Commerce website is the main platform where all the business 
transactions take place between a business organization and consumer directly. Amazon.
com is a good example of B2C e-commerce.
68  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
b) 
 Business-to-Business (B2B)
Business-to-Business (B2B) e-commerce is conducted between companies. Individual 
customer cannot buy from this type of e-commerce. Producers and wholesalers typically 
operate with this type of electronic commerce.
In this model, the product is first sold to wholesaler who then sells the product to the 
final customer. As an example, a wholesaler places an order from a company's website 
and after receiving the consignment, sells the end product to final customer who comes 
to buy the product at wholesaler's retail outlet. Alibaba.com is a good example of B2B 
e-commerce. 
c) 
Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) type of e-commerce is conducted  between consumers. 
Generally, these transactions are conducted through a third party, which provides the 
online platform where the transactions are actually carried out. Hamrobazaar.com is a 
good example of C2C website in Nepal.
Website following C2C business model helps consumer to sell 
their assets like residential property, cars, motorcycles etc. or 
rent a room by publishing their information on the website. 
Website may or may not charge the consumer for its services. 
Another consumer may opt to buy the product of the first 
customer by viewing the post/advertisement on the website.

M-Commerce
M-commerce (Mobile commerce) is the extended 
version of e-commerce. It refers to the process of 
buying and selling of goods and services through 
wireless handheld devices such as smartphones, 
tablets or personal digital assistants (PDAs). It 
is also known as next-generation e-commerce.
This includes purchases on websites or apps,

Introduction
These days technology has become a part of our life. We can’t imagine a life without 
Internet and Smartphones in urban areas and even in rural environments. Most of the 
services like Email, Social Network, E-Commerce, Chats, on-demand videos, live 
streaming etc. are becoming omnipresent and helping human beings to get connected 
with each other and get their work done efficiently and effectively. Behind all these 
services, there are many integrated technologies working together like Cloud Computing, 
Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, IoT, etc. 
1.5.1 Cloud Computing
Due to increased number of 
users, and increased complexity 
of software systems, demand 
for hardware resources like 
processors, memory, storage, 
network, database, software 
and other services has also been 
increased. In order to address 
this demand, companies like 
Amazon, Microsoft, Google, 
etc. are providing very large 
server farms and data centres 
over the Internet to multiple 
customers, who pay only for the resources they use. Because organizations using public 
clouds do not own the infrastructure, they don’t have to make large investment in 
their own hardware and software. Public clouds are ideal for small and medium-sized 
businesses who can’t afford to fully develop their own infrastructure; for applications 
requiring high performance, scalability, and availability.  Such model of computing in 
which processing, storage, software and other services are provided as a shared pool 
Unit 1.5
Contemporary Technology
74  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
of virtualized resources is called cloud computing. 
Companies offering these computing services are called cloud providers and typically 
charge for cloud computing services based on usage, similar to how we paid the bill 
for water, electricity, telephone at home. Some of the cloud providers are Amazon 
AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, VMware Cloud, Oracle Cloud and 
Alibaba Cloud.
You are probably using cloud computing right now, even if you don’t realise it. If you 
use an online service to send an email, edit documents, watch movies or TV, listen to 
music, play games or store pictures and other files, it is likely that cloud computing is 
making it all possible behind the scenes.
Here are a few of the things you can do with the cloud
 
Create new apps and services,
 
Store, back up and recover data,
 
Host websites and blogs,
 
Stream audio and video,
 
Deliver software on demand.
Examples of Services over Cloud
Microsoft Office 365: Internet versions of Word, Excel, 
PowerPoint, and OneNote accessed via your Web browser 
without installing anything.
Google Drive: This is a pure cloud computing service, with 
all the storage found online. So it can work with the cloud apps 
like: Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides. Google 
Drive is also available on more than just desktop computers; you 
can use it on tablets like the iPad or on smartphones, and there 
are separate apps for Docs and Sheets, as well. In fact, most of 
Google's services could be considered cloud computing; Gmail, 
Google Calendar, Google Maps, and so on.
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 75
Apple iCloud: Apple's cloud service is primarily used for online 
storage, backup, and synchronization of your mail, contacts, calendar, 
and more.
There are three basic types of cloud computing services
1. 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): In this type of cloud service, 
customer can use processing, storage, networking, and other computing resources 
from cloud service providers to run their software system. Customers are billed 
according to the usages of computing power and storage. 
2. 
Software as a Service (SaaS): Customer subscribes the software services from a 
vendor for an annual subscription fee or sometimes free and use it over Internet. 
Services like Gmail, Google Drive, Salesfore.com - very popular Customer 
Relationship Management Software (CRM), Office 365 are some of the examples 
of SaaS.
3. 
Platform as a Service (PaaS): Customer use infrastructure and programming 
tools and environment supported by the vendors to develop their own applications. 
IBM provides Bluemix for software development and testing on its cloud. 
1.5.2 Artificial Intelligence (AI)
In the past, a piece of software is written 
to do a well-defined task. If the same 
software has to do another similar task then 
it has to be re-written. Nowadays, due to 
advanced mathematical algorithms and high 
computations power of hardware, software 
can be designed to learn and adapt the results 
based on the data fed into it. This means, such software can work similar to human 
intelligence, such software can identify objects, animals, places, detect face, and talk 
like humans do. They can also suggest and recommend like human experts in respective 
field. Artificial Intelligence is the study and research of developing such software that 
can learn and, work like human brain. 
In other words, Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems or machines that mimic 
76  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on 
the information they collect.
AI technology is improving performance and productivity by automating processes or 
tasks that once required human intelligence. 
Some of the examples of AI are speech recognition (like Siri, Microsoft Cortana, 
Amazon Echo, Google Home etc.), spam email filter, self-driving cars, face recognition 
etc.  
1.5.3 Virtual Reality (VR)
In virtual reality, you experience a simulated 
environment that doesn’t actually exist, created 
through computer-based technologies that can give 
you a feel of near real world with all or some of 
your senses experiencing the virtually simulated 
environment. You can also interact with virtual 
objects within the virtual environment. You can 
swim with whales in oceans, fight with aliens, fly aeroplanes, visit distance places 
without being there and much more within the VR. 
These days, you can find various types of head-mounted display to experience virtual 
reality. You can also experience virtual reality in specialized cinema halls as well. 
1.5.4 E-Governance
E-Governance is a set of services provided by 
the government to public via electronic media 
especially using Internet. Examples of such 
services include paying their taxes online, 
requesting various services from government 
though governmental websites, providing 
information to public via government’s websites. 
The basic purpose of e-governance is to simplify 
processes for all, i.e. government, citizens, 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 77
businesses, etc. at National, State and local levels. E-governance expands to electronic 
governance, is the integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) 
in all the processes, with the aim of enhancing government ability to address the needs 
of the general public.
Benefits of E-governance
 
Increased convenience for public and businesses to services of government
 
Reduction in overall cost of transaction as services can be rendered anywhere
 
Corruption will be reduced as there will be direct interaction with the system and 
public without any intermediaries
 
High transparency
 
Direct participation of constituents
 
Expanded reach of government to all public irrespective of remoteness
Through e-governance, the government plans to raise the coverage and quality of 
information and services provided to the general public, by the use of ICT in an easy, 
economical and effective manner.
1.5.5 Mobile Computing
Mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, e-readers, wearable devices that have 
computing power, battery-powered, portable, and wirelessly connected to network 
have changed the way, we used to access the computing resources in the past. Due to 
advancement in technologies, such mobile devices have integrated various features 
like cameras, biometrics, sensors etc. Mobile computing is a generic term that refers 
to a variety of devices that allow people to access data and information from wherever 
they are. Sometimes referred to as "human-computer interaction," mobile computing 
transports data, voice, and video over a network via a mobile device.
Components of Mobile Computing
i. 
Mobile Hardware: Mobile hardware are generally small in size and highly 
portable with the ability to process data and give output based on inputs given 
by keypad, touch, voices or sensors. These devices are equipped with sensors, 
full-duplex data transmission and have the ability to operate on wireless networks 
78  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
such as IR, Wi-Fi, Cellular and Bluetooth.
ii. 
Mobile Software: Mobile Software is the software program which is 
developed specifically to be run 
on mobile hardware.  This is 
usually the operating system in 
mobile devices. These operating 
systems provide features 
such as touchscreen, cellular 
connectivity, Bluetooth, Wi-
Fi, GPS mobile navigation, 
camera, video camera, speech 
recognition, voice recorder, music player, near field communication and sensors. 
The device sensors and other hardware components can be accessed via the OS.
iii. 
Mobile Communication: Mobile Communication refers to the exchange of data 
and voice using existing wireless networks. The data being transferred are the 
applications including File Transfer (FT), the interconnection between Wide-
Area-Networks (WAN), facsimile (fax), electronic mail, access to the Internet 
and the World Wide Web. The wireless networks utilized in communication 
are IR, Bluetooth, W-LANs, Cellular, W-Packet Data networks and satellite 
communication system. It is the mobile communication infrastructure which takes 
care of seamless and reliable communication between mobile devices.
Principles of Mobile Computing
The following factors have been identified as the Principles of Mobile Computing.
i. 
Portability: Devices/nodes connected within the mobile computing system 
should facilitate mobility. These devices may have limited device capabilities 
and limited power supply but should have a sufficient processing capability and 
physical portability to operate in a movable environment.
ii. 
Connectivity: This defines the quality of service of the network connectivity. In 
a mobile computing system, the network availability is expected to be maintained 
at a high level with the minimal amount of lag downtime without being affected 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 79
by the mobility of the connected nodes.
iii. 
Interactivity: The nodes belonging to a mobile computing system are connected 
with one another to communicate and collaborate through active transactions of 
data.
iv. 
Individuality: A portable device or a mobile node connected to a mobile network 
often denotes an individual; a mobile computing system should be able to adopt the 
technology to cater the individual needs and also to obtain contextual information 
of each node.
1.5.6 Internet of Things (IoT)
Few years earlier only computers and servers 
were able to communicate with each other 
by sharing data and information. Due to 
advancement in technology, computer-like 
device can be integrated with any electronic 
devices enabling these devices to share and 
communicate data to intended users and 
systems. Devices that can sense or read the 
values of their surrounding environment are 
more likely to have application for sharing/
communicating information. Such devices 
when connected with server to communicate data from their surrounding are called 
Internet of Things (IoT). In a simple way, you have things (devices) that can collect 
data and are capable to send these data via Internet to Server or any intended users. For 
example, a car with a GPS sensor (thing) continuously transmits its location information 
to any user via Internet. A temperature sensor (thing) that is reading temperature of a 
particular location and transmitting that data via Internet to a Web Server so that anyone 
from the world can know the temperature of that location/place. 
Over the past few years, IoT has become one of the most important technologies of 
the 21st century. Now that we can connect everyday objects—kitchen appliances, 
cars, thermostats, baby monitors—to the Internet via embedded devices, seamless 
80  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
communication is possible between people, processes, and things.
By means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies, 
physical things can share and collect data with minimal human intervention. In this hyper 
connected world, digital systems can record, monitor, and adjust each interaction between 
connected things. The physical world meets the digital world—and they cooperate.

Many years ago, the concept of number system evolved when people used their fingers, 
sticks, pebbles, knots of rope and different symbols for counting and simple addition 
or subtraction. In course of time, people use calculator device and then computers for 
calculation.  The group of digits or symbols used to express quantities as the basis for 
doing different calculations is called number system.
Types of Number System
Nowadays, different types of number system have developed. Number system is 
differentiated by its base or radix. The base is defined as the total number of digits 
available in the number system. So, the number system is divided into main four types 
on the basis of base value. They are: 
1. 
Decimal number system,
2. 
Binary number system, 
3. 
Octal number system and
4. 
Hexadecimal number system.

Decimal Number System
The number system that we use in our day to day life is the decimal number system. 
Unit 1.6
Number System
84  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Decimal number system has base 10 as it uses 10 digits from 0 to 9. In decimal number 
system, the successive positions to the left of the decimal point represent units, tens, 
hundreds, thousands, and so on.
Each position represents a specific power of the base (10). For example, the decimal 
number 539 consists of the digit 9 in the units position, 3 in the tens position and 5 in 
the hundreds position. Its value can be written as
(539)10 
=(5×100)+(3×10)+(9×1)
 
 
= (5×102) + (3×101) + (9×100)
 
 
= 500 + 30 + 9
 
 
= 539
2. 
Binary Number System 
The number system that is used in computer system to hold any data on bits is the 
binary number system. Binary number system has base 2 as it uses 2 digits 0 and 1. For 
example 100012 , 111012 , 1012 , etc.
3. 
Octal Number System
The number system that is used in computer system to hold any data on byte is the 
octal number system. Octal number system has base 8 as it uses 8 digits from 0 to 7. 
For example 1208 , 65708 , 320708 , etc.
4. 
Hexadecimal Number System
The number system that is used in computer system to hold any data is the hexadecimal 
number system. Hexadecimal number system has base 16 as it uses 16 digits (10 digits 
from 0 to 9 and 6 letters from A to F). Letters represent the numbers starting from 10 
that is A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14 and F = 15. For example (7A2)16, (1AC)16, 
(56B)16, (BOD)16 etc.
Number System Conversion
People commonly use decimal number system in their daily life. Computer use binary, 
octal and hexadecimal number system according to its model or brand. We cannot easily

understand binary number system like this way computer can't understand decimal 
number system. So there are different methods to convert one number system to another 
as follows:

Binary Calculation
Generally, there are four types of binary calculation. They are:
1. 
Binary Addition,
2. 
Binary Subtraction, 
3. 
Binary Multiplication and 
4. 
Binary Division.

1. 
Binary Addition
Binary addition is similar to decimal numbers addition. Some rules for adding binary 
numbers are: 
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 10 (Write '0' here, carry 1 to next column)
Example:
 
1  0  1  0
 
+ 1  1  0  1
 
1 0  1  1  1
Hence, 1010  + 1101 =  1  0  1  1  1.
Binary Subtraction
Binary subtraction is similar to decimal number subtraction. Some rules for subtracting 
binary numbers are: 
0 - 0 = 0
1 - 0 = 1
1 - 1 = 0
0 - 1 = 1 (with borrow 1 from the left column)
 
1  0   1  1  1
 
- 1  0  1
 
1  0  0  1  0
Hence, 10 111 – 101 =  1  0  0  1  0.

Binary Multiplication
Binary multiplication is similar to decimal number multiplication. Some rules for 
multiplying binary numbers are: 
 
0×0=0
 
1×0=0
 
0×1=0
 
1×1=1
 
1 0 0 1

1 0 0 1
 
0 0 0 0
 
1 0 0 1
 
1 0 1 1 0 1
Hence 1001 ×101 = 101101
Binary Division
Binary division is similar to decimal number division. Some rules for dividing binary 
numbers are: 
0 ÷ 0 = 0
0 ÷ 1 = 0
1 ÷ 1 = 1
1 ÷ 0 = undefine
1 0 1

     1 1 0
 
   - 1 0 1
 
              1    Remainder
 
Hence, Quotient = 101
 
 
Remainder=1

2.1 Introduction to Database Management System
Every organization have to maintain data concerning their activities, business, transaction, 
employees etc. For example, your school maintains data regarding a student's general 
information, academic performance, punctuality and discipline. These data need to be 
kept in such a way that it can be readily available and can be presented easily in desired 
formats. The data also needs to be updated and appended regularly. Actually, these data 
are manually maintained in various files in most cases. 
As you can notice in the below Table - Telephone directory, it has information distributed 
under the headings, such as S.No. Name, Address, Telephone Number. Furthermore, 
the entire information is alphabetically organized for easy retrieval.
Table - Telephone Directory
S.No. Name

Well organized information as above is database. In other words, a collection of 
systematically organized inter-related data is called a database.  
Data and Information
Raw form of any facts, figures or entities are known as data. Data alone does not give any 
meaning. For example, Aaradhya, 1000, account, balance etc. are raw data individually 
does not give any meaning.
The processed form of data is known as information. When the data becomes information 
it gives meaningful result. For example, Aaradhya has 1000 balance in his bank account. 
Here Aaradhya, 1000, account, balance all have their significant meaning. Thus, we can 
say that information is the organized collection of inter-related data.

Purpose of Database
Database is used to store, organize and retrieve data. Database can be computerized and 
non-computerize (manual). A database may have single table or multiple tables. The 
data in a database are organized in rows and columns. Some examples of database are 
Telephone directory, mark ledger, attendance register, dictionary etc.
Database Management System (DBMS)
Database management system (DBMS) is a computerized 
system that stores data, processes them and provides 
information in an organized form. DBMS basically deals 
with the creation of database, its management and retrieval 
process. Creating, modifying, updating, appending, 
organizing, sorting, removing, and retrieving are the major 
tasks performed easily, efficiently and accurately using 
Database management system. Some of the popular DBMS software are MS-Access, 
Oracle, MS-SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL etc.
These DBMS are capable to handle records in multiple tables on the basis of a key field. 
It allows a user to view or retrieve records from the multiple linked tables continuously 
at a time. 
Features of DBMS
The following are the features of a DBMS:
 
Large volume of data can be stored and updated easily.
 
Provides data integrity and security.
 
Easy in data administration or data management.
 
Provides the data sharing facility.
 
Reduces the data redundancy (duplication of data).
 
Provides concurrent access, recovers the data from the crashes.
 
Supports centralized control

Components of Database
Table
Database is composed of one or more tables. Tables are the building block of database. 
A single table is used to store data of a specific purpose or subject such as telephone 
directory, book records in library etc. Since entire data is managed and kept in a table 
for the future retrieval process it is also called the primary object of database. Table 
stores large volume of data into rows called records and column called field. When 
fields and records are combined forms a complete table.

2.2 Creating Database Using Microsoft Access
An Introduction to Microsoft Access
MS-Access is DBMS software developed by Microsoft Corporation. This software is 
distributed along with the Microsoft Office application package. Microsoft Access 2019 
is the latest version available in the market. 
The Access database consists of several different components. Each component is called 
an object. Access consists of seven objects. The various objects of MS-Access are Tables, 
Queries, Forms, Reports, Pages, Macros and Modules. All objects of a database are 
stored in a single file, and the extension of database file is .accdb.
Main features of MS-Access
a) 
Creates sophisticated database quickly.
b) 
Analyse and modified your data easily with queries.
c) 
Creates elaborated reports from your data. 
d) 
Makes customized data entry forms.
e) 
Presents your data dynamically on the WWW (World Wide Web).
We will explore mainly the following four objects of MS-Access
a) 
Tables
All databases must have at least one table. Tables are the primary building block of 
database. All data are stored and managed in a table. Every table in a database focuses 
on one specific subject. Table stores large volume of data into rows and column.
b) 
Queries
A query is simply the question that we ask about the data stored in the table. Query 
is also used to perform various actions on the data. For example, "Show the names of 
students who have scored greater than or equal to 80 marks in science." "Update the 
salary of employees by 10%."
c) 
Forms
Forms are the graphical interface used to enter data into the tables or multiple linked 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 109
tables. Forms are also used to display the information in specific manner, as well as it 
permits user to add, modify and delete data in a table. Primarily, fields in the table or 
query are made available to place in the forms that we create. 
d) 
Reports
Reports are the presentation of information in desired format. Reports are generally 
created for the printing purpose of any desired information. With Access, we can create 
reports of any table or query. For example, report card of your final examination.
Starting MS-Access

Defining Data types
Data type determines the kind of values that you can store in 
the field. After you enter the valid field name, it allows a user 
to select the data type for the field. You can use the Data Type 
property to specify the type of data stored in a table field such 
as text for name field, number for class field, Date and time for 
DOB field etc. Each field can store data consisting of only a 
single data type. MS-Access supports the following data types:

Primary Key field
Primary Key
Primary Key is a special field or group of fields in the table that uniquely identifies each 
record from the database. To distinguish one record from another, table must contain 
a unique field named as primary key. The primary key does not accept duplicate value 
for a field and it does not allow a user to leave the field blank or null. The primary key 
is an identifier such as a student ID, a Product code, Exam roll no. etc. Hence, primary 
key is unique to each record.
Importance of Primary Key
 
To identify each record of a table uniquely.
 
To reduce and control duplication of the record in a table.
 
To set the relationship between tables.
Setting the Primary Key
Follow the below steps to create a primary key field:
Step 1: 
Open the table in Design View.
Step 2: 
Click on the field in which you want to apply primary 
key. 
Step 3: 
Click on Design tab.
Step 4: 
Click on Primary Key button from Tools group.
A key icon will be displayed on the left side of the primary key 
field.

control over the contents of a field we can set the field size, format, validation rule etc. 
The general properties of fields are given below:
Field Properties – Number
Field Properties – ShortText
a. 
Field Size
You can use the Field Size property to set the maximum size for data stored in the field 
that is set to the Text or Number data type. 
For Text data, the amount of data that you can store can be determined by the number 
of characters you wish to store on it. Maximum is 255 characters.
For numeric data, the field size can be set depending upon the type and range of value 
you wish to store. Below table explains about the numeric data range and storage.

Caption
Caption field property is the alternative name given for any field. This helps to make 
field name more explanatory. The maximum size for this is 2048 characters. It is also 
a label for a field when used on a form. If caption is not entered, field name is used for 
label for a field on a form.
c. 
Default Value 
Default Value field property is one that is displayed automatically for the field when 
you add a new record to the table. 
d. 
Format
Format field property allows you to display data in a format different from the way it 
is actually stored in a table. It is also known as display layout for a field. Depending on 
the type of data, the option in the Format menu will differ.
e. 
Input Mask
Input mask field property specifies the pattern 
of data that you wish to enter into the specific 
field. It is simply the control over the data 
entry. This field property does a couple of 
tasks in a field. They are:
 
It forces you to enter field values in a 
specified pattern.
 
It can fill in constant characters like 
dash (-), parenthesis ( ) and slash (/) and 
optionally store these characters as part 
of the field value as you do not have to enter these characters at the time of data 
entry.
f. 
Validation Rule
It is used to limit the values that can be entered into a field. Data validation in various 
cases are explained in the below table.

based on field or fields is known as sorting. 
 
Text types of data are sorted in alphabetical order (i.e. A to Z or Z to A). 
 
Date and Time data are sorted from oldest to newest or newest to oldest.
 
Number/Currency types of data are sorted in smallest to largest or largest to 
smallest.
Follow the below steps to sort data of Short 
Text field:
Step 1: 
Open the table in Datasheet 
View.

2.4 Querying Database
i. 
Query
Query is the question asked for the database. Information stored in any database becomes 
meaningful only when you will be able to retrieve the desired information. So, using 
the various types of queries you can retrieve the information that you desire with some 
specific purpose. So, query is an object of database that is used to view, retrieve, change 
and analyse records from a table or multiple linked tables based on specified condition. 
Using a query, you can answer very specific questions about your data that would be 
difficult to answer by looking at table data directly. You can use queries to filter your 
data, to perform calculations with your data, and to summarize your data. 
There are two main types of Query used in Access.
Select Query : This type of query serve data from the table as per the user’s request 
without making any change in the underlying data.
Action Query : This type of query changes data in the source table. The examples of 
Action Query are Update Query, Delete Query and Append Query.
a) 
Select Query
Select query is simply used to select and display 
the relevant data from the database. You can 
select all or part of data from a single or multiple 
tables or existing queries and display in datasheet. 
You can also use a select query to group records 
and calculate sums, counts, averages, minimum, 
maximum and other types of totals. 
Creating a Select Query
Follow the below steps to create a select query:
Step 1: 
Open the database file created in MS-Access.
Step 2: 
Click on Create tab.
130  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Step 3: 
Click on Query Design button from Queries group. QBE (Query By 
Example) grid will appear. Also, a Show Table dialog box will appear with 
the list of tables and queries created in the database.
Step 4: 
Select the required table based on which you are creating query. Click on 
Add.
Step 5: 
Click on Close button.
QBE Grid
The QBE grid appears with two sections. The upper section shows the list of fields in 
the selected table and the lower section shows the grid with rows and columns where 
we define the query.
The first row in the grid shows the fields that we have selected from the table. 
The second row shows the table from which the field is selected. 
The third row is ‘Sort’. We can select ‘Ascending’, ‘Descending’ or ‘Not sorted’ for 
sort. If we set sorting option (ascending or descending) for more than one field then 
the leftmost field for which sorting is enabled becomes the primary sort key and other 
sorting enabled fields subsequently become the secondary sort keys.
Show row has check box for each field. The fields that are checked at this row are 
displayed and those not checked are not displayed. 
The fifth row is ‘Criteria’. Here, we can provide criteria or condition to select the 
records from the table. 
The last row is ‘or’. Here, we provide the criteria which are tested with OR logical 
operator with the above condition or criteria mentioned in the row ‘Criteria’. 
Now, do the following tasks in the QBE grid:
Step 1: 
First you need to bring the required field of table in the grid. We can drag 
or double click each field to bring them in the grid. So, bring the required 
field of the selected table from the upper section of QBE. 
Step 2: 
Choose the fields and select either Ascending or Descending from the Sort 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 131
row, if you want to display the result in sorted order of any field. 
Step 3: 
Remove the tick (√) mark from the checkbox of the Show row, if you don’t 
want to show field(s).
Step 4: 
Set the criteria in Criteria row. In this example, “10” is written in the Class 
field and “A” is written in the Section field. It means only the records of 
Class 10A are selected in the query.
Running the Query
After making a query, you need to run. Follow the below steps to run a query:
Step 1: 
Click on the Design tab under Query Tools.
Step 2: 
Click on Run button from Results group. A new datasheet 
will be displayed based on the criteria and other settings we 
provided in the query. 
Result of the above query

Computer Science : Grade 10
Calculation in Select Query
As mentioned earlier, select query can be used for mathematical calculation and display 
the result in new field. Let’s explore the below example to understand how to perform 
this.
Step 1: 
Create a below table in MS-Access and named as “Marks”
Design View – Table Marks
Datasheet View – Table Marks
Step 2: 
To create a query, click on Create tab and click on Query Design button 
from Queries group. 
Step 3: 
Select the table “Marks” from the Show Table dialog box. Click on Add 
and then Close. 
Step 4: 
Bring all the fields of “Marks” in the QBE grid. 
Step 5: 
In the QBE grid, type a new field name “Total” next to the field “Computer” 
and use the below expression to calculate Total marks.
 
 
Total: [English] + [Math] + [Computer]
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 133
Step 6: 
Run the query. You will see the new column with calculated total marks.
b) 
Action Query
An action query is a query that makes changes to or removes many records in just one 
operation. Here, we discuss only two types of action query. Below are the four different 
types of action queries.
i) 
Update Query
An update query makes entire changes to a record or group of records in one or more 
tables. For example, you can increase the salary of all staff by 10% from a single 
operation in the staff database. With an update query, you can change data in existing 
tables. 
Let’s explore the below example to understand how to perform this.
Step 1: 
Create a below table in MS-Access and named as “Staff”
Design View – Table Staff
Datasheet View – Staff
Step 2: 
To create a query, click on Create tab and click on Query Design button 
from Queries group. 
134  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Step 3: 
Select the table “Staff” from the Show Table dialog box. Click on Add and 
then Close. 
Step 4: 
From the Design tab, select Update type from Query Type group.
Step 5: 
As we are going to update the value of Salary field only, bring the field 
“Salary”  of “Marks” in the QBE grid by double-clicking on it. 
Step 6: 
Type the below expression in the “Update To” row:
 
 
[Salary]*1.1
Step 7: 
Run the query.
Step 8: 
A message box will appear for your confirmation. Click on Yes. And see 
the below updated result in the table “Staff”.
Before Update – Table Staff
Before Delete – Table Marks
ii) 
Delete Query
A delete query deletes a record or group of records from one or more tables. For example, 
you can delete the records of those students who have got marks less than 40 in each 
subject in the marks database.
Let’s explore the below example to understand how to perform this.
Step 1: 
Open the database file that has the table “Marks”
Step 2: 
To create a query, click on Create tab and click on Query Design button 
from Queries group. 
Step 3: 
Select the table “Marks” from the Show Table dialog box. Click on Add 
and then Close. 
Step 4: 
From the Design tab, select Delete type from Query Type group.
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 135
Step 5: 
You need to give criteria to select records in order to erase. In this example, 
we are erasing the records of those students who have got marks less than 40 
in each subject. So, we have to apply condition in all the fields of subjects. 
Bring all the subject fields in the QBE grid by double-clicking on them. 
Step 6: 
Provide condition in the Criteria row as in below figure.
Note: Here, the condition <40 for each subject is given in the different lines of criteria 
to use OR operator. If you write the condition in the same line of Criteria row, 
AND operator will be applied. 
Step 7: 
A message box will appear for your confirmation. Click on Yes. And open 
the table to check whether the records are deleted or not.
After Delete – Table Marks
Before Delete – Table Marks
iii) Inserting records into table from queries
Using a query, you can insert record into a desired table. Let’s explore the below example 
to learn how to insert new record using SQL statement.
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to communicate with database. 
We can use several SQL statements to do different tasks with your database. Here, 
INSERT statement is used to insert record into a table. 
136  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Follow the below steps to insert a new record using INSERT SQL statement:
Step 1: 
Let’s assume you have already created the below table “Marks”. If not, 
create this table first where you are going to insert new record using query.
Step 2: 
Click Create tab and click Query Design from Queries Group. 
Step 3: 
Close the Show Table window.
Step 4: 
From the Design tab, click on the SQL View button in Results group. A 
SQL View window will appear.
Step 5:  
Type the below INSERT statement in the SQL View window as below 
figure.
Table Marks
In the above INSERT statement, 
Marks 
–  Name of the table
6,'Rabin Shahi',78,54,32  –  Values for 5 fields (Text field value is enclosed within 
single quote 'Rabin Shahi')
Step 6: 
Run the query. A message will appear for your confirmation. 
Step 7: 
Click Yes and open your table to see new records.
insert into Marks values (6,'Rabin Shahi',78,54,32) ;
Computer Science : Grade 10

2.5 Creating and Using Forms
Forms
Form is one of the MS-Access database objects that is primarily used to create an 
interface for entering data in a table or multiple linked tables. Forms are basically GUI 
(Graphical Users Interface) using which users interact with MS-Access database. Form 
also displays complete record one at a time, so you can view and modify records using 
the form. 
Creating form by using the wizard
The wizard enables you to select the fields from a table or multiple linked tables, layout, 
and user interface for the form.  Follow the below steps to create forms using the wizard 
option:
Step 1: 
Open the Access database file. 
Step 2: 
Click on Create tab. 
Step 3: 
Click on Form Wizard button from 
Forms group. Form Wizard dialog 
box will appear.
Step 4: 
Choose the required table from the Tables/Queries drop-down list.
Step 5: A list of fields of the selected table will be displayed. Now, you have to select 
the fields that you want to keep in the form from the Available Fields box. To 
select fields as per the requirement, click on single arrow 
 button to select 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 141
a single field or you can also select all the available fields at once by clicking on 
double arrow 
 button. After selecting fields click on Next button.
Step 6: 
Select the desired layout. In this example, Columnar is chosen. Click Next.
Step 7: 
Type the title of the form. In this example, Marks_Forms is typed. 
Step 8: 
Click on Finish button.
Now, the form for the Marks table is created as below:
 
   
Click here and type 
to edit field values
New (blank) Record
Last Record
Next Record

Computer Science : Grade 10
Entering Data Using a Form
After the form is created, you can enter the data simply typing in the text box. MS-Access 
form also contains the various control options while entering the data. These control 
options are, Text box, Combo box, List box, Check box, Label, Command button, Tab 
control, Image, hyperlink etc. Steps to add records in form datasheet are as follows:
 
After you open form datasheet, mouse cursor will be placed in the first field of 
first record. Type the required data in the field.
 
Press Tab or enter to move to the next field. Or, simply place the mouse cursor 
in the desired field.
 
When you finish entering the all the data for the first record, MS-Access 
automatically prompts for entering the second record and so on.
Summary
 
Form is one of the MS-Access database objects used to view, modify and add 
records.
 
The Form Wizard enables you to select the fields from a table or multiple linked 
tables, layout, and user interface for the form.

2.6 Creating and Printing Reports
Report
Report is one of the MS-Access database objects used to present information in an 
effective and organized format that is ready for printing. Using the report, you can 
display the information the way you want to view it. A report's record source refers to 
the fields in the underlying tables and queries. A report need not contain all the fields 
from each of the tables or queries that it is based on. Creating a report is very similar 
to creating a form. 
Creating Report by using Wizard
The wizard enables you to create a report in a desired format. The Report Wizard 
provides you with more flexibility such as you can choose the tables and fields, group 
the data, sort the data, summarize the data, choose a layout and orientation, apply a 
style, and title your report. 
Follow the below steps to create a report using Wizard:
Step 1: Open the Access database file. 
Step 2: Click on Create tab. 
Step 3: Click on Report Wizard button from Reports 
group. Report Wizard dialog box will appear.
Step 4: Choose the required table from the Tables/Queries drop-down list.
144  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Step 5: A list of fields of the selected table will be displayed. Now, you have to select 
the fields that you want to keep in the form from the Available Fields box. To 
select fields as per the requirement, click on single arrow 
 button to select 
a single field or you can also select all the available fields at once by clicking 
on double arrow 
 button. After selecting fields click on Next button
Step 6: On the next wizard screen, you can further group records in the report by a 
particular field. To group by a field, click the field and then click the arrow 
button. You can select several grouping levels in the order you want them. 
Then click Next to move on.
Step 7: The wizard then asks 
whether you would like 
to sort the records in the 
report as in the below 
figure If you want to 
sort the records by a 
particular field or fields, 
open the top drop-down 
list and select a field 
by which to sort. Click 
Next to move on.
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 145
Step 8: On the next wizard, select the required Layout and Page Orientation. Click 
Next.
Step 9: Type the title of the report. In this example, Marks_Report is typed. 
Step 10: Click on the Finish button.
Now, the Report for the Marks table is created as below:
Viewing and Printing Reports in Print Preview
When you create a report with 
Report Wizard option, the report 
appears in Print Preview (as 
shown in above figure). From 
there, you can print the report if 
it is ok or go to Report Design 
view to make changes. In the 
Print Preview mode, you can zoom in and out on the report using the Zoom tool (click 
once to zoom in and click again to zoom out). Using the appropriate button on the Print 
Preview toolbar, you can also display the report as one page, two pages, or multiple pages.

Introduction
Modular programming is a technique used to divide our program into many small 
logical, manageable and functional modules or blocks. Every modular program has 
one main module and may have many sub modules. The module of a program is also 
called procedure.
Advantages of Modular Programming
Some advantages of modular programming are: 
 
Many programmers can write different program modules independently. 
 
The debugging of the program becomes easier and faster.
 
The same procedure can be used in different places, which reduces the program 
codes.
 
It improves the readability of a program.
 
It is easy to design code.
Main Module
Sub Module A
Sub Module B
Sub Module C
Modular Programming in QBASIC
We can handle modular programming in QBASIC by two ways:
a) 
Sub-procedure
b) 
Function-procedure
Unit 3.2
Modular Programming
158  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Creating Sub-procedure
Sub-procedure
A sub-procedure is a small manageable and functional part of a program that performs 
specific tasks and does not return any value to the calling module. A sub procedure is 
needed to define before it is used in a program. A CALL statement is used to call the 
sub procedure in a program. 
A sub program is written with SUB…..END SUB statement.
There are two parts of sub-program in QBASIC:
a) 
Declaration Part
b) 
Definition Part
Declaration Part of Sub-Procedure
To create a sub-program in QBASIC, we need to declare at first. We use DECLARE 
statement for this purpose.
DECLARE statement
Purpose: a non-executable statement that declares references to QBASIC sub-program
Syntax:
DECLARE SUB <name> [(<Parameter List>)]
 
name is the name of the sub-program (sub-procedure or procedure) that will be 
used to call the procedure
 
parameter list  indicates the number and type of arguments that will be used to 
call the procedure
Example:
DECLARE SUB Sum (A, B)
In the above example, Sum is the name of the procedure whereas A and B indicates 
the parameter list.
Definition part of Sub-Program
The second step of creating a sub-program is to include the statement associated with 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 159
its tasks. We use SUB….END SUB statement to define a sub-program. 
SUB...END SUB statement 
Purpose: a procedure statement that 
marks the beginning and end of a 
subprogram
Syntax:
SUB <name> [(parameter List)] 
<body (codes)>
………..
END SUB
Example:
SUB Sum (P, Q)
 
c = P + Q
 
PRINT "Sum = "; c
END SUB
 
While defining a sub-procedure, 
press Enter key after typing Sub 
<name> (Parameter List).
 
A new window will appear which 
is called a sub-module or a sub-procedure. The body of sub-program is written 
between SUB… END SUB of this window.
To switch between the windows:
You can move either from sub-module to main-module or from main-module to sub-
module by pressing SHIFT+F2 keys at the same time.
or
You can press only F2 key to display the list of procedures along with main-module. 
You can choose the required name of procedure from this list to switch into it. 
160  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Executing sub-programs
To run a sub-program, you need to use CALL statement in the main-module.
CALL statement 
Purpose: a statement that transfers control to another sub procedure from main module.
Syntax:
CALL <name> [(<argument list>)]
 
name is the name of the SUB
 
argument list lists the variables or constants passed to the SUB
Example:
CALL Sum (P, Q)
Let’s see the whole program now:
DECLARE SUB Sum (a, b)
CLS
INPUT "First Number "; a
INPUT "Second Number "; b
CALL Sum (a, b)
END
SUB Sum (P, Q)
 
c = P + Q
 
PRINT "Sum = "; c
END SUB
Output: 
Type First Numer ? 45
Type Second Number ? 6

Computer Science : Grade 10

Call by Reference and Call by Value
Call by Reference
Call by reference is a method of calling a procedure in which the reference (address) 
of parameters are passed to the calling procedure module instead of actual value. By 
default, the parameters are passed using call by reference method.
Example:
DECLARE SUB test (p, q)
CLS
p = 10
q = 5
CALL test (p, q)
PRINT p, q
END
=====================
SUB test (a, b)
a = a + 5
b = b + 5
END SUB
Output: 
15 
10
In the above program, while calling the sub-program test, the parameter p and q are 
passed to the sub procedure test using call by reference method. In the sub module, 
reference/address of p and q are passed to sub module and stored in the local variable 
a and b respectively. When the value of 'a' is increased by 5, the change occurs in the 
variable 'p' of main module. In the same way, the value of ‘q’ of main module is also 
increased by 5.
So, the values of 'p and q' are increased by 5 and the output is 15 10.
162  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Call by value
Call by value is a method of calling a procedure in which actual data are passed to 
the calling procedure module. It is done by enclosing each parameter by a separate 
parenthesis ( ).
Example:
DECLARE SUB display (n)
CLS
n = 5
CALL display ((n))
PRINT n;
END
==================
SUB display (p)
p = p + 5
END SUB
In the above program, while calling the sub-program display, the parameter 'n' is passed 
to the sub procedure display using call by value method. In the sub module, value of 
'n' is passed to sub module and stored in the local variable 'p'. When the value of 'p' 
is increased by 5, the change occurs in the variable 'p' of sub module as 'p' does not 
contain the reference of 'n'. 
So, the value of 'n' is not increased by 5 and the output is: 5
Formal and Actual Parameter
Formal parameters are variables which are used to specify or declare types of data to be 
passed to the procedures either sub or function. A formal parameter is always variable(s).
Actual or Real parameters are arguments which are used to pass real value or data to the 
procedure. Actual parameters may be variables or constant values. An actual parameter 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 163
can also be in the form of expression.
Example:
DECLARE SUB SUM (A, B)
M=10
N=20
CALL SUM (M, N)
END
==================
SUB SUM (P, D)
 
S=P+D
 
PRINT “Sum of Two numbers”; S
END SUB
Local variable and Global variable
A variable which is defined in a module and is not accessible to any other modules is 
known as local variable. It is only accessible to the module where it is defined. Value 
of local variable is destroyed when execution of module is over.
Example:
DECLARE SUB test ()
CLS
a = 10
CALL test
END
===========
SUB test
 
PRINT a
END SUB
In this example,
M and N are actual parameters or Arguments
A, P, B and D are formal parameters
Output:
     0
The variable ‘a’ used in this program is a local variable 
and declared in main module. So, its scope is limited to

A variable in main module which can be accessed from any module or procedure of 
a program is known as a global variable. Variable can be made global declaring them 
with DIM SHARED or COMMON SHARED or SHARED attribute. 
Declaring global variable in Main module:
COMMON SHARED and DIM SHARED statements are used to declare global 
variables in main module.
a) 
COMMON SHARED Statement
Syntax:
COMMON SHARED variable list
variable list is a group a one or more variables separated by a comma.
Example: 
COMMON SHARED a, b, c
b) 
DIM SHARED Statement
Syntax: 
DIM SHARED variable list
variable list is a group a one or more variables separated by a comma.
Example: 
DIM SHARED a, b, c
Declaring global variable in Sub-module:
SHARED statement is used to declare global variables in sub-module.
a) 
SHARED statement
Syntax: 
SHARED variable list
variable list is a group a one or more variables separated by a comma.
Example: 
SHARED a, b, c

Example #1
DECLARE SUB test ()
COMMON SHARED a
CLS
a = 10
CALL test
END
===========
SUB test
PRINT a
END SUB
Example #2
DECLARE SUB test ()
CLS
CALL test
PRINT M
END
===========
SUB test
SHARED M
M = 5
END SUB
Output:
10
In this program, the variable ‘a’ is declared as global in 
main module using COMMON SHARED statement. 
So, it is recognized in sub-module also. Therefore, 
the statement PRINT a gives 10 on the output screen.
Output:
5
In this program, the variable ‘M’ is declared as 
global in sub module using SHARED statement. So, 
it is recognized in main-module also Therefore, the 
statement PRINT M gives 5 on the output screen.

Now, let’s practice some program using sub-procedure in computer lab. 
Example #1
REM to calculate area of a circle
DECLARE SUB area (r)
CLS
INPUT "Type radius "; r
CALL area(r)
END
===============
SUB area (r)
a = 22 / 7 * r ^ 2
PRINT "Area = "; a
END SUB
Example #2
REM To display multiple table
DECLARE SUB MT (n)
CLS
INPUT "Type a number "; n
CALL MT(n)
END
===============
SUB MT (a)
FOR i = 1 TO 10
        PRINT a; "x"; i; "="; a * i
NEXT i
END SUB
Note
Unlike Function procedure, Sub-
Procedure does not return any 
value. So, we do not give any 
symbol after the sub-procedure 
while declaring and defining it.
Note
Sub-Procedure does not return 
any value. So, we can use PRINT 
statement inside sub-procedure. 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 167
Example #3
REM To check odd or even
DECLARE SUB check (n)
CLS
INPUT "Type any number "; p
CALL check(p)
END
===============
SUB check (w)
IF w MOD 2 = 0 THEN
        PRINT "Even"
ELSE
        PRINT "Odd"
END IF
END SUB
Example #4
REM To display first 10 natural numbers
DECLARE SUB series ()
CLS
CALL series
END
===============
SUB series
FOR i = 1 TO 10
        PRINT i;
NEXT i
END SUB
Note
We can use different parameter 
names in declare, call and sub 
statement. But the number of 
parameters and theirs types must 
be same.
Note
This sub-procedure is created 
without parameter. If we don’t 
need to pass any values to sub-
module from main-module, we 
can leave blank in the place of 
parameter list.
168

Example #5
REM To check palindrome word or not
DECLARE SUB check (k$)
CLS
INPUT "Type a string "; s$
CALL check(s$)
END
===============
SUB check (n$)
FOR i = 1 TO LEN(n$)
        b$ = MID$(n$, i, 1) + b$
NEXT i
IF n$ = b$ THEN
        PRINT "It is palindrome"
ELSE
        PRINT "It is not palindrome"
END IF
END SUB
Example #6
REM To calcualte area and volume
DECLARE SUB calc (l, b, h)
CLS
INPUT "Type length of a room "; l
INPUT "Type breadth of a room "; b
INPUT "Type height of a room "; h
CALL calc(l, b, h)
END
Note
Formal Parameter – n$, k$
Actual Parameter jf argument – s$
Computer Science : Grade 10

===============
SUB calc (l, b, h)
a = l * b
v = l * b * h
 
PRINT "Area = "; a
 
PRINT "Volume = "; v
END SUB
b) 
Creating Function Procedure
Function-procedure
There are many functions including LEN( ), MID$( ), ASC( ) etc. available in QBASIC 
as library function. But they are not sufficient for programmers. So, in some cases, 
we have to make such function ourselves. This type of function is called user-defined 
function because it is created by the user.
A user-defined function is written with FUNCTION … END FUNCTION statement.
Declaration part
DECLARE statement
Purpose: a non-executable statement that declares references to QBASIC user-defined 
function
Syntax:
DECLARE FUNCTION <name> [(<Parameter List>)]
 
name is the name of the function that will be used to call the function
 
parameter list indicates the number and type of arguments that will be used to 
call the function.
Note: DECLARE statement cannot be used after any executable statements. The same 
DECALRE statement for function procedure is used to declare sub-program
Example:
DECLARE FUNCTION Area (L, B)
Note
Sub-Procedure does not return 
any value. So, we can define a 
sub-procedure for multiple output. 
It can perform more than one 
calculations.
170  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Definition part
FUNCTION...END FUNCTION statement
Purpose: a non-executable statement that defines the user-defined function
Syntax:
FUNCTION <name> [(<Parameter list>)] 
<Body (Codes)>
………..
<name> =Expression
END FUNCTION
 
name, name of the function
 
parameter list is one or more variables, separated by commas that will be passed 
to the function when it is called
 
expression is the return value of the function
Example:
FUNCTION Area (P, Q)
A = P * Q
Area = A
END FUNCTION
Calling a User-Defined function
Since the function always returns a value, we can assign this value to another variable 
or print directly on the output screen. CALL statement cannot be used in user-defined 
function. 
Example:
c = Area(L, B)
PRINT "Area is "; c
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 171
 
 
or
PRINT "Area is "; Area(L, B)
Let’s see the whole program now:
 
DECLARE FUNCTION Area (L, B)
 
CLS
 
INPUT "Type Length "; L
 
INPUT "Type Breadth "; B
 
c = Area(L, B)
 
PRINT "Area is "; c
 
END
 
FUNCTION Area (P, Q)
 
 
A = P * Q
 
 
Area = A
 
END FUNCTION
Output:
Type First Length ? 5
Type Breadth ? 3
Area is 15

Let’s practice some program using function-procedure in computer lab.
Example #1
REM To calculate Simple Interest
DECLARE FUNCTION SI (a, b, c)
CLS
INPUT "Type Principal "; p
INPUT "Type Time "; t
INPUT "Type Rate "; r
PRINT "Simple Interest = "; SI(p, t, r)
END
===============
FUNCTION SI (p, t, r)
i = (p * t * r) / 100
SI = i
END FUNCTION
Example #2
REM To calculate circumference
DECLARE FUNCTION cir (r)
CLS
INPUT "Type radius of a circle "; r
c = cir(r)
PRINT "Circumference = "; c
END
===============
FUNCTION cir (r)
circum = 2 * 22 / 7 * r
cir = circum
END FUNCTION
Note
The value returned by the 
function can be printed directly.
Note
The value returned by a 
function can be assigned to 
another variable.
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 173
Example #3
REM To display the smaller number
DECLARE FUNCTION small (a, b)
CLS
INPUT "Type any two numbers "; x, y
PRINT "Smaller number is "; small(x, y)
END
===============
FUNCTION small (a, b)
IF a < b THEN
        small = a
ELSE
        small = b
END IF
END FUNCTION
Example #4
REM To count vowels
DECLARE FUNCTION vow (a$)
CLS
INPUT "Type any string "; s$
PRINT "No. of Vowels = "; vow(s$)
END
===============
FUNCTION vow (a$)
FOR i = 1 TO LEN(a$)
b$ = UCASE$(MID$(a$, i, 1))
IF b$ = "A" OR b$ = "E" OR b$ = "I" OR 
b$ = "O" OR b$ = "U" THEN c = c + 1
NEXT i
vow = c
END FUNCTION
Note
We can assign the value 
to be returned by the 
function anywhere inside 
the definition part of 
function-procedure.
Note
There is no any symbol 
after the function name. 
So, the default return type 
of the function is Single 
Precision. The function 
returns Single Precision 
value.

Example #5
REM sum of individual digits of an integer
DECLARE FUNCTION sum% (a%)
CLS
INPUT "Type an integer "; b%
PRINT "Sum of individual digit = "; sum%(b%)
END
===============
FUNCTION sum% (c%)
WHILE c% <> 0
        r% = c% MOD 10
        s% = s% + r%
        c% = c% \ 10
WEND
sum% = s%
END FUNCTION
Example #6
REM To display the reverse of a string
DECLARE FUNCTION rev$ (n$)
CLS
INPUT "Type any string "; s$
PRINT "Reverse is "; rev$(s$)
END
===============
FUNCTION rev$ (a$)
FOR i = 1 TO LEN(a$)
        b$ = MID$(a$, i, 1) + b$
NEXT i
rev$ = b$
END FUNCTION
Note
This function returns 
an integer value. 
T h e r e f o r e ,  a  % 
symbol is written after 
the function while 
declaring, calling and 
defining the function.
Note
This function returns a 
string value. Therefore, a 
$ (dollar sign) symbol is 
written after the function.

Summary
 
The process of writing a program in more than one module is called modular 
programming. 
 
We can handle modular programming in QBASIC in two ways: Sub-programs 
and User-Defined Function.
 
SUB ---- END SUB statement is used to define a sub-procedure and CALL 
statement is used to use sub-procedure in main module.
 
FUNCTION ---- END FUNCTION statement is used to define a user-defined 
Note
A function can return only 
one value. Therefore, two 
functions area and volume 
are created to calculate area 
and volume separately.

function. 
 
Function returns a value whereas Sub-procedure does not return any value.
 
Function is used to perform only one calculation. Sub-procedure can be defined 
for multiple tasks.

Introduction 
The collection of different data or information or instructions, which is stored in 
secondary storage devices under a unique file name, is known as file. In QBasic, two 
different files are used they are program files and data files.
File handling is a process to create a data file, write data to the data file and read data 
from the specified data file.
Data file is a collection of data such as name, address, class, etc. required for data 
processing.

The set of instruction written in a computer language for data processing under unique 
file name is known as program file.
QBASIC supports two types of file handling: Sequential and Random Access files 
handling.
Sequential Access to a data files means that the computer system reads or writes 
information to the file sequentially, starting from the beginning of the file and proceeding 
step by step. On the other hand, Random Access to a file means that the computer system 
can read or write information anywhere in the data file.
In this lesson, we will discuss sequential file handling.
Basic File Operation
There are basically three file operations we can perform in QBASIC. They are:

a) 
Opening the File
b)

a) 
Opening a file
While writing into the file or reading from file, first we need to open the file.
OPEN statement
Purpose: a file I/O statement that enables I/O to a file
Syntax:
OPEN file [FOR mode] AS [#]filenum 
 
spelt is a string expression that specifies a file to be opened for writing or reading
 
mode is one of the following keywords:
INPUT 
- Read only from sequential file
OUTPUT - Write to a sequential file
APPEND - Write to the end of a file
 
filename is an integer expression whose value is between 1 and 255

Output or “O”
To create a new sequential data file and write data in it. It starts 
writing data always from the beginning of the file (BOF).
Input or “I”
To read / display data or information from the existing sequential 
data file.
Append or “A”
To add more records in the existing sequential file. It starts adding 
of data always from the end of the file (EOF).
Mode
If file exists
If file does not exists
Output or “O”
Creates a new file
Creates a new file
Input or “I”
Opens the existing file
Error Message
"File not found"
Append or “A”
Opens the existing file
Creates a new file
Example #1: 
 
It creates and opens a new file named “STUDENT.DAT” to store records.
Example #2:
It creates and opens a new file “MARKS.DAT” in D: Drive to store records.
Note: When you open the file in OUTPUT mode which is already existed, your old 
file will be overwritten by the new one and the records in the old file is not accessible. 
Example #3:
 
It opens the existing file “MARKS.DAT” to add more records.
OPEN “STUDENT.DAT” FOR OUTPUT AS #1
OPEN “D:\MARKS.DAT” FOR OUTPUT AS #2
OPEN “MARKS.DAT” FOR APPEND AS #1
190  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Note: When you open an existing file in APPEND mode, the same file will be opened. 
If the file does not exist, then it creates a new file as by OUTPUT mode.
Example #4
OPEN “STAFF.DAT” FOR INPUT AS #1
 
It opens the existing file “STAFF.DAT” to read records from this file.
Note: The error message will be shown if the file does not exist. 
Alternative Syntax of OPEN Statement
We can use OPEN Statement in alternative way as well. 
Syntax: PEN <filemode>, #<file number >, <filename> 
Example #5:
OPEN “O”, #1, "MARK.DAT”   - Opens the file in output mode.
OPEN “I”, #1, “MARK.DAT”  - Opens the file in input mode.
OPEN ”A”, #1, “MARK.DAT”  - Opens the file in append mode.
b) 
Storing Records into a Data File 
Follow the below steps to store records into a data file:
i) 
Open the file in output mode for new file and open the file in append file if you 
want to add records in an existing file
ii) 
Ask the data from the user
OPEN “ MARKS.DAT” FOR OUTPUT AS #1 
INPUT “NAME”, N$
INPUT “ADDRESS”, A$ 
INPUT “ENGLISH”, E
INPUT “MATH”; M
INPUT “SCIENCE”; S
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 191
iii) 
Use WRITE # or PRINT # Statement to store records.
iv) 
Ask for other records.
v) 
Close the file.
WRITE # statement
Purpose: a file I/O statement that writes data to a sequential file
Syntax:
WRITE #filenumber, expressionlist
 
filenumber is an integer used in an OPEN statement for the file.
 
expressionlist is one or more string or numeric expressions, separated by commas.
Example #1:
 
It writes (stores) the values stored in the variables N$,A$,E,M,S in the file having 
file number #1. The WRTIE # statement puts comma (,) between each field values 
and encloses the string values by double quotes (“ ”)
PRINT # statement
Purpose: a file I/O statement that writes data to a sequential file
Syntax:
PRINT #filenumber, expressionlist
 
filenumber is an integer used in an OPEN statement for the file.
 
expressionlist is one or more string or numeric expressions, separated by commas.
Example #2:
 
It writes (stores) the values stored in the variables N$,A$,E,M,S in the file having 
file number #1. The PRINT # statement puts some spaces instead of comma (,) 
between each field values and does not enclose the string values by double quotes 
(“ ”)
WRITE #1, N$, A$, E,M,S
PRINT #1, N$, A$, E,M,S
192  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
c) 
Closing file(s)
You must close the file after read or write into the data file. CLOSE # statement is used 
to close a data file.
CLOSE statement
Purpose: a file I/O statement that concludes I/O to a file
Syntax:
CLOSE [[#]filenumber[,[#] filenumber]...]
 
If all arguments are omitted, all open files are closed
 
filenumber is the number of an open file
Example #1:
CLOSE #1 
 
It closes the file having file number #1.
Example #2:
CLOSE #1, #2 
 
It closes both files having file number #1 and #2. 
Example #3:
CLOSE
 
It closes all the files opened in the entire program.
Now, let’s practice some programs in computer lab.
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 193
Program #1
OPEN "MARKS.DAT" FOR OUTPUT AS #2
CLS
INPUT "Type Name of student "; n$
INPUT "Type Address "; a$
INPUT "Marks in English "; E
INPUT "Marks in Math "; M
INPUT "Marks in Science "; S
WRITE #2, n$, a$, E, M, S
CLOSE #2
END
The above program crates a new file “MARKS.DAT” and stores student’s name, address, 
English, Math and Science stored in n$, a$, E, M and S respectively. The program closes 
the file after storing a record only one time. 
Program #2
OPEN "MARKS.DAT" FOR OUTPUT AS #2
top:
CLS
INPUT "Type Name of student "; n$
INPUT "Type Address "; a$
INPUT "Marks in English "; E
INPUT "Marks in Math "; M
INPUT "Marks in Science "; S
WRITE #2, n$, a$, E, M, S
INPUT "More Records (y/n) "; ans$
IF UCASE$(ans$) = "Y" THEN GOTO top
CLOSE #2
END
194  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
The above program does the same tasks as Program #1. Additionally, it asks for new 
records after storing each record. The program will run till the value of ans$ is “Y” or “y”.
Program #3
OPEN "MARKS.DAT" FOR OUTPUT AS #2
FOR i = 1 TO 5
        CLS
        INPUT "Type Name of student "; n$
        INPUT "Type Address "; a$
        INPUT "Marks in English "; E
        INPUT "Marks in Math "; M
        INPUT "Marks in Science "; S
        WRITE #2, n$, E, M, S
NEXT i
CLOSE #2
END
The above program stores 5 records.
Program #4
OPEN "MARKS.DAT" FOR APPEND AS #3
top:
CLS
INPUT "Type Name of student "; n$
INPUT "Type Address "; a$
INPUT "Marks in English "; E
INPUT "Marks in Math "; M
INPUT "Marks in Science "; S
WRITE #3, n$, a$, E, M, S
INPUT "More Records (y/n) "; ans$
IF UCASE$(ans$) = "Y" THEN GOTO top
CLOSE #2
END
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 195
The above program opens an existing file “MARKS.DAT” and adds the new records. 
If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.
d) 
Reading Data from a File
Follow the below steps to read data from a file:
Open the file in INPUT mode.
Example:
OPEN “MARK.DAT” FOR INPUT AS #7
Or
OPEN “1” #7, “MARK.DAT”
The above statements open the file “MARK.DAT” in INPUT mode so that you can 
read records from this file.
ii) 
Read records from the file
To read records from an existing file, we use INPUT # statement.
INPUT # statement
Purpose: a file I/O statement that reads data items from a sequential file and assigns 
them to variables
Syntax:
INPUT #filenumber, variablelist
 
filenumber is the number of an open sequential file
 
variablelist is one or more simple variable names, separated by commas that will 
be assigned values from the file. Make sure the data type of each variable in the 
list matches the data type of the incoming data item.
Example:
INPUT #7, n$, add$, a, b, c
Note: The number of variables and their types must be matching to the fields of data 
stored in the data file.
196  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
LINE INPUT # statement
Purpose: a file I/O statement that reads an entire line without delimiters from a sequential 
file to a string variable
Syntax:
LINE INPUT #filenumber, stringvariable
 
filenumber is the number of an open sequential file
 
stringvariable will hold all characters from the current line of the sequential file
Example:
LINE INPUT #7, s$
How to read all the records from a data file?
INPUT # statement reads one record at a time. Therefore, we have to use a loop to read 
all the records. The loop should be terminated after reading all the records. 
EOF (check end of file) 
EOF means END of FILE. It is a function used to check whether the record pointer 
reaches at end of file or not. When you open a file in INPUT mode, the record pointer 
points the first record and it is moved to the second record once the first record is read 
by INPUT # statement. In the same way, if the record reaches at end of file, the EOF 
function returns TRUE. 
EOF Statement
Syntax:
EOF (file number) 
iii) Display the records on output screen
Once you read the records using INPUT # statement, they are stored in variables. The 
next step is to display the data on screen. You can simply use PRINT statement for this 
purpose. 
Example:
PRINT n$, add$, a, b, c
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 197
iv) 
Close the file
Use CLOSE # statement to close the file.
Let’s practice some file handling program in the computer lab.
Program #1:
REM Read data from a file
OPEN "MARKS.DAT" FOR INPUT AS 
#7
CLS
WHILE NOT EOF(7)
        INPUT #7, n$, add$, a, b, c
        PRINT n$, add$, a, b, c
WEND
CLOSE #7
END
The above program opens the file “MARKS.DAT” in input mode and read and displays 
all the records on the screen.  
Program #2:
REM Read data from a file
OPEN "MARKS.DAT" FOR INPUT AS #7
CLS
FOR i = 1 TO 5
        INPUT #7, n$, add$, a, b, c
        PRINT n$, add$, a, b, c
NEXT i
CLOSE #7
END
198  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
The above program opens the file “MARKS.DAT” in input mode and read the first five 
record from this file.
Program #3:
REM Read data from a file
OPEN "MARKS.DAT" FOR INPUT AS #7
CLS
FOR i = 1 TO 5
        LINE INPUT #7, n$
        PRINT n$
NEXT i
CLOSE #7
END
The above program opens the file “MARKS.DAT” in input mode. Here, LINE INPUT 
statement is used to read record. So, each record (single line) is read at a time and stored 
in n$. It is used when the number and types of fields of data file are unknown. 
Example 1:
REM To store student's name, class and roll
OPEN "student.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #5
top:
INPUT "Student’s name"; n$
INPUT "Class "; c
INPUT "Roll number "; r
WRITE #5, n$, c, r
INPUT "More records?", y$
IF y$ = "y" THEN GOTO top
CLOSE #5
END
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 199
Example 2:
REM To read data from a sequential file
CLS
OPEN "student.txt" FOR INPUT AS #7
WHILE NOT EOF (7)
 
INPUT #7, a$, b, c
 
PRINT a$, b, c
WEND
CLOSE #7
END
INPUT$ function
Purpose: a file I/O function that returns a string of characters read from the specified file
Syntax:
INPUT$(n[,[#]filenumber])
 
n, a numeric expression, is the number of characters to read from the file
Example:
OPEN "student.txt" FOR INPUT AS #2
PRINT INPUT$(12, 2)
Alternative syntax of OPEN statement
Syntax:
OPEN FILEMODE, filenum, file
Examples:
OPEN “I”, 2,” INFO.DAT” is same as OPEN “INFO.DAT” FOR INPUT AS #2
OPEN “O”, 3,” INFO.DAT” is same as OPEN “INFO.DAT” FOR OUTPUT AS #3
OPEN “A”, 4,” INFO.DAT” is same as OPEN “INFO.DAT” FOR APPEND AS #4

Computer Science : Grade 10
File Management Commands
a) 
FILES
Purpose: To display the list of  files residing on the specified disk
Syntax:
FILES [filespec]
 
If all arguments are omitted, all files in the current directory are listed
 
filespec is a string variable or constant that includes either a filename or 
pathname and an optional device name
Example:
FILES
FILES “*.bas” [Lists all files with .bas extension in the current directory]
b) 
CHDIR
 
Purpose: To change the current default directory for the specified drive
 
Syntax:
 
CHDIR pathspec
 
pathspec is a string expression that identifies the directory that is to become 
the default directory
Example:
CHDIR “D:\QBASIC” [Changes the current default directory to D:\QBASIC]
c) 
MKDIR
Purpose: To create a new directory
Syntax:
MKDIR pathspec
 
pathspec is a string expression that identifies the directory to be created
Example:
MKDIR “d:\QBASIC” [Creates a directory named QBASIC in D:]
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 201
d) 
RMDIR
Purpose: To remove an existing empty directory
Syntax:
RMDIR pathspec
 
pathspec is a string expression that identifies the directory to be removed
Example: 
RMDIR “d:\QBASIC”   [Removes the directory named QBASIC in D:]
e) 
NAME … AS 
Purpose: To change the name of a disk file or directory
Syntax:
NAME old filename AS new filename
 
oldfilename, a string expression, is the name of an existing file.
 
newfilename, a string expression, must be a filename that does not exist
Example:NAME “banepa.bas” AS “dhulikhel.bas”
[It changes the name of the old file “banepa.bas” as new name “dhulikhel.bas”]
f) 
KILL 
Purpose: To delete a file
Syntax:
KILL filespec
 
filespec is a string expression that identifies the file to delete. The filespec 
may include a path specification.
Example:
KILL “C:\QBASIC\dhulikhel.bas”
[It erases the file named “dhulikhel.bas” saved inside the directory “QBASIC” 
of drive C:]
202  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
g) 
SHELL
Purpose: To execute a DOS command
Syntax:
SHELL [commandstring]
Example 1:
SHELL
[It displays the DOS prompt window. Now, you can run any DOS command]
Example 2:
SHELL "dir/p"
[It executes the DOS command "dir/p" from QBASIC window without opening 
DOS prompt windows and displays the list of files and sub-directories from the 
current location page wise.]
h) 
SYSTEM 
This command is used to close QBASIC program window.
Example: 
SYSTEM
A sample program using file management commands in File handling:
Program #1:
A sequential data file “class.txt” has several records having fields student’s name, class 
and roll number. Write a program to copy all the records from “class.txt” into another 
new file “student.txt”.
OPEN "class.txt" FOR INPUT AS #1 
OPEN "student.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #2 
WHILE NOT EOF (1)
 
INPUT #1, N$, C, R
 
WRITE #2, N$, C, R 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 203
WEND
CLOSE #1, #2 
END
Program #2:
A sequential data file "records.txt" has several records having fields Employees’ Name, 
Post and Salary. Write a program to increase the salary of all employees by 10%. 
OPEN "records.txt" FOR INPUT AS #1 
OPEN "temp.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #2 
WHILE NOT EOF (1)
 
INPUT #1, E$, P$, S
 
WRITE #2, E$, P$, S*1.1 
WEND 
CLOSE #1, #2 
KILL "records.txt" 
NAME "temp.txt" AS "records.txt" 
END
It’s not possible to update the records directly in QBASIC. So, a temporary file “temp.
txt” is created where all the records of “records.txt” are copied after increasing its salary 
field by 10%. Finally, the original file “records.txt” is erased and the temporary file 
“temp.txt” is renamed as “records.txt”.
Note: Press F6 key to switch between the Main Window and Immediate Window.

Summary
 
File handling is a mechanism to work with file so that we can read and write data 
from and into a disk file through QBASIC program.
 
There are three basic file operations: a) Open the file b) Read/Write data and c) 
Close the file.
 
Output mode creates a new file and opens it to store data.
 
Append mode opens an existing file to add records.
 
Input mode opens and existing file to read records.
 
File must be closed after read or write data.
 
Some file management commands are FILES, MKDIR, CHDIR, RMDIR, 
NAME...AS, KILL and SYSTEM.

4.1 Introduction 
Computer cannot do anything by itself. It requires proper instructions to do any sort 
of tasks. A set of these instructions is called a program. A program is created to solve 
a particular task and a group of these programs is called software. We have already 
known that there are different types of programming language to write programs such 
as High-Level Language, Assembly Language and Low Level Language. There are 
several approaches of programming which include Structured, Unstructured, Procedural, 
Modular, Object Oriented programming etc. 
4.2 Structured Programming 
Structured programming (sometimes known as modular programming) follows a 
top-down approach, in which programmer separates the overall program structure 
into different subsections. A defined function or set of similar functions is coded in a 
separate module or sub module, which means that code can be loaded into memory 
more efficiently and that modules can be reused in other programs. After a module 
has been tested individually, it is then integrated with other modules into the overall 
program structure. Some examples of structured programming languages are Pascal, 
C, PLII, Ada etc. 
4.3 Features of Structured Programming:
a) 
Top-Down Design
The top-down approach is the process of breaking down the complex problem into 
simpler ones. In programming also, top-down approach is the stepwise process of 
breaking down large and complex program into several simpler modules to organize 
and code in an efficient way.

In the above example, the main program is “Payroll” which is broken down into several 
modules and sub-modules.   
b) 
Single–Entry, Single–Exit Concept 
One of the main features of structured programming is that its modules have only one 
entry and exit points. It does not support Go To statement. This feature makes easier to 
understand the flow of control of the program. 
Single-Entry, Single-Exit concept can be achieved from the three fundamental Control

i) 
Sequence Structure

C Programming 
Introduction
C Language is a high-level structured programming language. Normally this language 
is used to develop system software. The C programming language was developed by 
Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs during the early 1970s. Quite unpredictably it derived from 
a computer language named B and from an earlier language BCPL. Initially designed 
as a system programming language under UNIX, it expanded to have wide usage on 
many different systems. 
Features of C Language
There are certain features of C language. They are:
a) 
Structured
C is a Structured Programming Language. Like QBASIC, we break down a program in 
several small modules in C. The module is called function. It makes the programmer 
easier to manage and debug the code
b) 
Middle Level Language
It combines elements of a high level language with some features of assembler. As a 
middle level language, C language manipulates memory address. 
c) 
Fast
It is many time faster than BASIC. Due to the variety of data type and a list of powerful 
operators, programs written in C are fast and efficient.
212  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
d) 
Case Sensitive 
C is a case-sensitive programming language. It understands the capital alphabets and 
small alphabets as different values. For example, “Computer” and “COMPUTER” are 
different values for C Language. 
e) 
Extendable 
C is also an Extendable Programming Language.  We can develop functions in C 
Language and can be added in library for the purpose of using in other programs.
Limitation of C Language 
C has some limitation though it is a powerful programming language. Some of its 
limitation are: 
a) 
No Run Time Type Checking 
b) 
Does not support object oriented programming
c) 
C doesn't have the feature of reusability of source code extensively 
d) 
C language has only 32 Keywords
e) 
C provides no data protection
f) 
C compilers can only identify errors and are incapable of handling exceptions 
(run-time errors).
Application of C Language 
C was initially used for system development work, in particular, the programs that 
make-up the operating system. It is mainly because it produces code that runs nearly 
as fast as code written in assembly language. But C language is not limited to develop 
system software.

Data Types in C
C Language supports two types of data: 
a) 
Basic Data Types 
b) 
Derived Data Types

Basic Data Types of C Language
i) 
int (Integer)
An Integer is a whole number either positive, negative or zero but no decimal values. 
For example, 0, -5, 10
Sub-types of Integer
C supports the different types of integer. Different integer types also have different ranges 
upto which they can store numbers. These ranges may vary from compiler to compiler. 
Below is list of ranges along with the memory requirement and format specifies on 
32-bit gcc compiler.

Declaring an integer variable
 
 
 
In the above example, the int keyword is used to declare a and b as integer variables. 
Likewise, we can declare integer variable in this way as well.
Here, the type of the variable is declared as unsigned int. It takes 4 bytes of memory 
and can hold the integers between 0 and 4,294,967,295.

void 
void means “nothing” or “null value”. We cannot create any variable of void type.
For example, 
void hello (void) 
{
………………….
}
The above function “hello” does not require any parameter and also does not 
return any value. 
C Token
C tokens are the basic buildings blocks in C language which are constructed together to 
write a C program. Each and every smallest individual unit in a C program are known 
as C tokens.
C tokens are of six types. They are:
a) 
Keywords (eg: int, while),
b) 
Identifiers (eg: main, total),
216  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
c) 
Constants (eg: 10, 20),
d) 
Strings 
(eg: “total”, “hello”),
e) 
Special symbols (eg: (), {}),
f) 
Operators (eg: +, /,-,*)
C keywords (reserved word)
Keyboardis a set of special words which are already defined for some tasks. C has only 
a set of 32 keywords, which have their predefined meaning and cannot be used as a 
variable name. These words are also known as “reserved words”.

Special Characters in C Language
Identifiers
Identifiers are the names given to the entities such as variables, functions, arrays 
structures and unions. 
For example,
Here, price and total are called identifiers.
Rules for naming Identifiers: 
i) 
The Identifier must start with an alphabet or an under score (_). 
ii) 
Identifier can be made from the combination of alphabets, digits and under score.
iii) 
No any C keyword can be used as an Identifier. 
iv) 
Identifier must be unique and can be used for a single purpose only. 
Format Specifier
The format specifier is used during input and output operation. It tells the compiler what 
int price;
float total;
218  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
type of data is stored in a variable during the input and output operation such as taking 
data from keyboard and display data on the screen. Some examples are %c, %d, %f, etc.

Variables in C 
A variable is used to hold data within your program. A variable represents a location in 
your computer's memory. Every variable has two parts, a name and a data type.  
Variable declaration
A variable declaration states the types of the variable, variable name and if necessary 
initializes the variable to a given value. 
For e.g.
int count;int number_of_students = 30;
Now, let’s look a whole program in C:
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 219
/* This is my C program */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
void main()
{
 
int a,b,c;
 
printf ("Enter the first number ");
 
scanf("%d",&a);
 
printf ("Enter the second number ");
 
scanf("%d",&b);
 
c=a+b;
 
printf("Sum = %d",c);
 
getch();
}
C Program
There are four steps of writing program in C. Each step has its own importance and 
must be completed stepwise.
Step 1:
At first, the program is written in C Compiler editor. It is called source code. This source 
code can be saved as a program file and its extension is .C. This source code can be 
edited at any time. 
The above C program asks any two 
numbers from the keyboard and 
displays their sum. In this program, 
three variables a,b and c are used and 
their types are declared as integer (int). 
Unlike QBASIC, we need to declare 
the type and name of the variables in 
the beginning of the program.
220  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Step 2:
The second step is to compile the source code. During compilation, syntax error is 
checked and removed from the source code. After compiling, the source code is changed 
into binary format and creates a new file with the extension .obj. It is called object 
program which cannot be edited. 
Step 3:
The third step is called linking process. In this process, the required libraries are linked 
to the program. Libraries prepare an appropriate environment to execute the C program. 
Step 4:
After the linking process, an executable file is created with the extension .exe. This 
executable file can be run in any other computer without compiler.

Example of a C Program
/* To find the product of any two numbers */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
void main()
{
 
int a,b,c;
 
clrscr();
 
printf ("Type first number ");
 
scanf ("%d",&a);
 
printf ("Type second number ");
 
scanf ("%d",&b);
 
c=a*b;
 
printf ("Product = %d",c);
 
getch();
}
Note: clrscr() function is similar to CLS statement in QBASIC. It erases the previous 
contents of the output screen. The clrscr() function is defined in the header file <conio.h>
Parts of a C Program
i) 
Pre-processor directives 
As part of compilation, the C compiler runs a program called the C pre-processor. The 
preprocessor is able to add and remove code from your source file. One of the major 
functions of C preprocessor is Tokenizing. The final step of the preprocessor is to link 
the resulting program with necessary programs and library.
While writing program in C, we need to include different header files in the beginning. 
In the above program, printf ( ) and scanf ( ) functions are used for output and input 
operation. These functions are defined in the header file <stdio.h>. So, this header file 
is included at the beginning of program which contains the code of printf() and scanf() 
functions. All the code of header files will be added to the program during compilation. 
Pre-processor directives

Computer Science : Grade 10
C Header Files
Different library functions are used to do different tasks in C language. For example, 
we use scanf() function to ask data from keyboard. Each function is defined in a special 
type of file. These files are called Header File and have extension .h. These header files 
must be included using #include directive otherwise the compiler doesn’t understand the 
library function we use and gives an error message. Here is the list of some commonly 
used Header file and their purposes:
Header Files Purpose
Functions Declared
stdio.h
Used for standard input and 
output (I/O) operations.
printf(), scanf(), getchar(), putchar(), 
gets(), puts(), getc(), putc(), fopen, 
fclose(), feof()
conio.h
Contains declaration for console 
I/O functions.
clrscr(), exit()
ctype.h
Used for character-handling or 
testing characters.
isupper(), is lower, isalpha()
math.h
Declares mathematical 
functions and macros.
pow(), squr(), cos(), tan(), sin(), 
log()
stdlib.h
Used for number conversions, 
storage allocations.
rand(), srand()
string.h
Used for manipulating strings. strlen(), strcpy(), strcmp(), strcat(), 
strlwr(), strupr(), strrev()
ii) 
Global Directives 
In this section of C program, Global variables and User-defined function are declared. 
iii) main () function
C program must start with main() function. This is the entry point of the program. 
iv) 
{ } Parenthesis
In C language, each function is defined inside parenthesis ({ }).
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 223
v) 
User-defined function 
As in QBASIC, we can create different user-defined function as per our requirements.
Output Function in C
Output function is used to show the calculated result or output on the screen. In C 
language, printf() is one of the output function defined in <stdio.h> header file. 
printf() function 
In C Language, printf() function is used to print the valued on the screen. It is defined in 
<stdio.h> header file. So, the header file <stdio.h> must be added to use this function. 
Syntax: 
printf(“format string”,argument list); 
format string is the combination of format identifier, escape sequence or string constant. 
Escape Sequence 
Escape Sequence is a pair of character that is used with printf() function to display 
non-printing character or a special character on the screen. 
Some Examples of Escape Sequence:
\n 
- 
new line 
\t 
- 
tab
\b 
- 
backspace 
\o 
- 
null character 
\? 
- 
question mark 
\\ 
- 
slash
\' 
- 
single quote 
\” 
- 
double quote 
224  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
Format Identifier 
We need to include format identifier to tell the data type in the area of format string of 
printf() function. For example,  
Variable Type
Format Identifier
char
%c
int
%d
long int
%ld
float
%f
String Constant 
String constant is a message to be displayed along with the other values stored in 
variables. It is enclosed within double quotation (" "). 
Argument List 
It is a list of variables to be used in printf ( ) function.
For example,
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
void main()
{
int a=5,b=10;
clrscr();
 
printf("\n Value of a and b are %d and %d ",a,b);
 
getch();
}
In the above program,
\n prints from a new line 
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 225
"Value of a and b are" → String Constant  
%d → Format Identifier of int data type  
a,b → Arugement List (Variables) 
The output of the above program: 
 
Note: Each C statement must be terminated by a semicolon(;).
Input Function in C
Input function is used to ask data for processing. In C language, scanf() is one of the 
input function defined in <stdio.h> header file. 
scanf() Function 
scanf() is one of the most important functions of C Program. This function is also defined 
in the header file <stdio.h> and used to ask value from keyboard. 
Syntax:
scanf("format string", argument list);
format string is the combination of format identifier, escape sequence or string constant. 
226  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
For example
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
void main()
{
 
int a;
 
clrscr();
 
printf ("Type an integer ");
 
scanf ("%d",&a);
 
printf ("\n The value of a is %d.",a);
 
getch();
}
In the above program,
scanf ("%d",&a);
%d → Format Identifier of int data type
&a → & – address operator, a – variable  
This function in the above program asks an integer form keyboard and stores in the 
variable ‘a’.
The output of the above program
getch() function
getch() function is another input function of C language. This function is defined in the 
header file <conio.h>. This function is used to ask any one character from keyboard.
Computer Science : Grade 10   
 227
For example,
#include <conio.h>
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
 
char ch;
 
clrscr();
 
ch=getch();
 
printf("The typed character is %c.",ch);
 
getch();
}
Note: You can see the use of getch() function in every example of C program in this 
book. The purpose of using this function in the sample program is to let the user to 
read output on the screen. If such type of function is not used, the output screen will be 
closed immediately after showing the output and returns to the coding window. In the 
above program, after showing the output by printf() function, getch() asks a character 
and get chance to see the output until the character is not typed. 
Arithmetic Calculations in C Program  
There are basically four types of arithmetic operations: 
i) 
Addition 
ii) 
Subtraction
iii) 
Multiply
iv) 
Division
To perform the above arithmetic operations, C language supports the below arithmetic 
operators:

p=t/3; //Full mark for all subject is 
100
 
printf("\nTotal Marks = %d ",t);
 
printf("\nPercentage = %f ",p);
 
getch();
}
Logical Calculation in C 
The calculation that is done based on one or more conditions is called logical calculations. 
Several relational or comparison operators are used to check the condition which gives 
True or False as a calculated result. 
Relational Operators in C
Relational Operator checks the relationship between two operands and returns either 1 
(True) or 0 (False). In C programming, relational operators can be used to take decisions 
and provide condition in looping statements. 
/* Calculate total marks
and percentage */
/* … */ is also used to write comment 
in C Language. It is used to write 
comments in one or more lines.

Control structures in C
C is a structured programming language. Control structures form the basic entities of a 
“structured programming language“. C supports three types of basic control structures, 
which are used to alter the flow of execution of the program.  
a) 
Sequence structure (straight line paths)
b) 
Selection structure (one or many branches)
c) 
Loop structure (repetition of a set of activities)
a) 
Sequential Structure
In sequential structure, the statements are executed 
one after another sequentially from top to bottom 
without changing the flow of program. 
b) 
Selection Structure
It is also called branching structure. In this structure, the control of the program is 
transferred from one part of the program to another on the basis of specified condition 
or without condition.

if statement 
if statement is used to test one or more condition and execute statement(s) if the given 
condition is True. 
Syntax:
if (condition)
{
statements
…………………
 }
If the condition mentioned in the syntax is True, then the statements written inside the 
parenthesis {   } will be executed. 
Example:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
void main()
{
 
int a;
 
printf ("Type your marks ");
 
scanf ("%d",&a);
 
if(a>=40)
 
{
 
 
printf ("You are Pass");
 
 
printf ("\nCongratulations!!!");
 
}
 
getch();
}
Output:
234  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
if … else statement
The previous if statement executes the statement only if the given condition is True. 
This statement is used to check one or more condition and execute the condition either 
the condition is True or False. 
Syntax :
if (condition) 
{ 
statements
………….. 
}
else 
{ 
statements 
………….. 
}
Example:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
void main()
{
 
int a;
 
clrscr();
 
printf ("Type your marks ");
 
scanf ("%d",&a);
 
if(a>=40)
 
{
 
 
printf ("You are Pass");
 
}
 
else
 
{
 
 
printf ("You are Fail");
 
}
 
getch();
}
Output:

Looping in C
The looping statement allows a set of instructions to be performed repeatedly until a 
certain condition is fulfilled. The looping statements are also called iteration statements. 
Looping statements in C 
C provides three kinds of loops:  
i) 
while loop 
ii) 
do loop 
iii) 
for loop 
i) 
while loop
The w hile loop continues executing a block of code till the given condition is t rue. The 
loop will be terminated when the condition becomes false. 
Syntax:
initial variable declaration 
while (condition)
{ 
statements
………………
// increment of counter
}
Example:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
void main()
{
 
int num=1;
 
clrscr();
 
while (num<=10)
 
{
 
 
printf ("%d ",num);
 
 
num++;
 
}
 
getch();
}
Output:
238  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Computer Science : Grade 10
In the above program, the value of variable (counter) num is initialized as 1. The loop 
continues till the values of num is less than or equal to 10. In each iteration (loop), the 
current value of num is printed and the value of num is increased by 1. When the value 
of num becomes 11, the condition becomes false and the loop will be terminated. 
ii) 
do loop 
The d o loop also executes a block of code as long as a condition is satisfied. The 
difference between a "do" loop and a "while" loop is that the while loop tests its condition 
before the execution of loop; the "do" loop tests its condition after the execution of loop.
Syntax:
initial value declaration 
do 
{ 
statement 
………………
// increment of counter
} while (condition);
#include <stdio.h>
#include <conio.h>
void main()
{
 
int num=1;
 
clrscr();
 
do
 
{
 
 
printf ("%d ",num);
 
 
num++;
 
} while (num<=10);
 
getch();
}
Output:

Difference between while/do loop
iii) for loop 
The for loop can execute a block of code for a fixed number of repetitions. It is easy to 
use and defined in a single statement. 
while loop
do loop
Test expression (condition) is checked at 
first. 
Code is executed at first then the condition 
is checked.
It is also called entry-controlled loop 
elgG5.
It is also called exit-controlled loop elgG5
